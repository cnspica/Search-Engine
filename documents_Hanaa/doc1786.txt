    &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/2015/11/a-guide-to-the-dc-cinematic-multiverse/"&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;, we examined the history and future of the various DC Comics cinematic franchises that make up what I (apparently alone) am calling the DC Cinematic Multiverse. But DC isn&amp;#8217;t the only company to have a massive tangle of cinematic universes under its belt. It&amp;#8217;s long-time rival Marvel has been even more prolific when it comes to adapting their material for the large and small screen. Unlike DC, though, Marvel gave up control over much of it&amp;#8217;s catalog during the dark times (the 1996 bankruptcy and subsequent reorganization), resulting it several different studios having access to bits and pieces of the Marvel world. To this day there is still a lot of confusion over who has what rights, who can be in which films, and on-screen with who else, and which films belong to which shared canon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="font-size: 80%"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: As with the DC post, I am mostly ignoring the animated parts of the Marvel multi-verse. There have been 36 (to date) animated shows and about a dozen animated movies.&nbsp; In general, with&nbsp;two&nbsp;notable exceptions, these shows all exist in their own separate universes, with their own separate designations in the Marvel reality catalog, and otherwise play no role in the live-action TV or movie worlds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, as we did with DC, lets see if we can make some sense of of the tangled mess that is the &lt;strong&gt;Marvel Cinematic Multiverse&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;span id="more-2639"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Reality Numbers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea of having a lot of separate, fragmented versions of their characters is certainly nothing new to Marvel. Their source comics are famous for having thousands of one-off, spin-off, what-if, alternate-timeline and even alternate-universe settings, where variations on their characters exist as distinct people with distinct pasts. Marvel has gone so far as to identify each of these variations with a &amp;#8220;Marvel Reality Number&amp;#8221;. These numbers are occasionally published in the various editions of the&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&lt;/em&gt;, and a more up-to-date list can be found &lt;a href="http://www.marvunapp.com/master/earthteaz.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, curated by one of the &lt;em&gt;Official Handbook&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8216;s chief editors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The primary reality number for&nbsp;the printed source material is&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Earth-616&lt;/strong&gt;, the mainstream Marvel universe. In general, issues of Marvel&amp;#8217;s comic books take place there unless otherwise specified. A second, more recent print setting is the&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Earth-1610&lt;/strong&gt; Ultimate universe, a &amp;#8220;reboot&amp;#8221; of Marvel&amp;#8217;s entirely history which was created&nbsp;in 2000. The latter is notable for being the source of much of the inspiration for the recent popular movies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not all Marvel properties have been given a reality number, but a whole, whole, whole lot of them have been. Whenever possible, the official reality numbers are given here, to help identify and distinguish those properties that do or do not exist within the same shared universe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Early Days&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/04/MCM_EarlyDays.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2649" src="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/04/MCM_EarlyDays-300x223.png" alt="MCM_EarlyDays" width="300" height="223" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike DC comics, which historically (thanks mostly to Batman and Superman) had a very strong live-action presence in both TV and movies, Marvel&amp;#8217;s big-screen presence prior to the late-1990&amp;#8217;s was very limited. There were a handful of movies and a bunch of television shows produced during that time; while the&nbsp;animated shows were pretty popular, the live-action ones did not fare very well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first big-screen adaption of Marvel&amp;#8217;s (actually, at the time, Timely Comic&amp;#8217;s) work came in 1944, with a&nbsp;Captain America film (actually a serial film, broken up into 15 parts) made by Republic Pictures. They had previously adapted other super-hero properties to film, but &lt;em&gt;Captain America&lt;/em&gt; was their last.&nbsp;While the film was generally well received by critics, it was way over budget, and was hardly even a Captain America&nbsp;movie. It contained none of the traditional elements of the Captain America character: he was not a solider, was not named Steve Rogers, didn&amp;#8217;t fight Nazis, and carried a pistol&nbsp;instead of a shield, just for starters. It&amp;#8217;s generally assumed that the movie was written for a different character (likely Fawcett/DC character Mr. Scarlet) but was changed at the last minute. Marvel included a nod to this movie in &lt;em&gt;Captain America: The First Avenger&lt;/em&gt;, in which Steve Rogers stars in a serial film early in his career.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After that, the next time Marvel&amp;#8217;s work appeared on&nbsp;film was in&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Howard the Duck&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;in 1986, followed&nbsp;by direct-to-video adaptations&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Punisher&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Captain America&lt;/em&gt;. All three of these films were dismal failures, and the disastrous reception of&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Howard the Duck&lt;/em&gt; would scare film studios away from any theatrical&nbsp;movie based on a Marvel property until after the bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During this same period, Marvel was&nbsp;also dipping its foot into the small-screen pool, trying out a couple of&nbsp;live action TV series based on their characters. Their first attempt was &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; in 1977, which was popular but ultimate cancelled by CBS (who felt they had too much comic-book material on their network). Between 1977 and 2000, about a dozen live-action shows&nbsp;and made-for-TV movies were put on the air, including two really bad X-Men rip-offs, another&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Captain America &lt;/em&gt;movie, and a &lt;em&gt;Nick Fury&lt;/em&gt; movie starring David Hasselhoff. None of these adaptations was very well received, and they have all been mostly lost into&nbsp;the mists of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shining diamond in among all of this rough is was the highly popular &lt;em&gt;The Incredible Hulk&lt;/em&gt; television franchise. The only genuinely successful franchise in Marvel&amp;#8217;s portfolio prior to &lt;em&gt;Blade&lt;/em&gt;, the show would eventually encompass not only 5 seasons of episodic television, but three made-for-TV movies between 1977 and 1990. Collectively, these make up the Marvel universe&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Earth-40005&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Movie License&nbsp;Explosion&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the mid 1990s, Marvel was experiencing some major financial problems (for a number of reasons), which led to Marvel Entertainment Group filing for bankruptcy. Soon after that, Marvel&amp;#8217;s new CEO decided to take advantage of their vast, untapped vault of characters by bringing them to the big screen. Marvel Entertainment Group formed a new&nbsp;movie production company, Marvel Studios, to turn their comic properties into feature films.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marvel had previously&nbsp;optioned a few characters to film studios, and had gotten frustrated&nbsp;that none of them ever came to fruition. Most notably, Fox licensed the X-Men characters as early as 1993, and a Spider-Man man movie had been &amp;#8220;in production&amp;#8221; for almost 25 years. In addition, there had been the occasional &amp;#8220;contractually obligated&amp;#8221; movie, such as an unreleased &lt;em&gt;Fantastic Four&lt;/em&gt; movie, that were&nbsp;produced with no intention of ever&nbsp;being seen &amp;#8212; they existed solely to allow the studios to hold onto their properties a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marvel&amp;#8217;s new idea&nbsp;this time around was&nbsp;to sell &amp;#8220;pre-packaged&amp;#8221; movies, with Marvel controlling all of the pre-production and creative aspects, e.g. writing, casting, hiring directors, etc., and handing off to a bigger studio for filming and distribution. Ultimately, Marvel&amp;#8217;s executives didn&amp;#8217;t have quite that much creative control over their movies, but even so, CEO Avi Arad began aggressively&nbsp;working to get Marvel characters into movie theaters. The first movie produced and filmed and distributed under this new system &amp;#8212; and the first in over 10 years &amp;#8212; was &lt;em&gt;Blade&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the course of the 1990&amp;#8217;s, dozens&nbsp;of Marvel&amp;#8217;s character licenses&nbsp;would be&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;by at least six different movie studios. The success of &lt;em&gt;Blade&lt;/em&gt; finally spurred these studios to start converting their own properties into movies, and between 2002 and 2007, 15 Marvel-based movies would be released.&nbsp;Each&nbsp;of these movies exists in their own separate universe &amp;#8212; the idea of a shared movie universe hadn&amp;#8217;t yet cropped up. That idea would have to wait for Marvel to decide to take matters into their own hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Off-Brands&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While most of Marvel&amp;#8217;s cinematic properties are based on characters from their primary Earth-616 universe, or their alternative Earth-1610 Ultimate universe, there are a few movies that are based on completely unrelated properties. These movies have done pretty well in the theater, but few people associate them with Marvel Comics. These include properties&nbsp;that are&nbsp;published through Marvel&amp;#8217;s Icon Comics imprint, which they use to publish creator-owned series. The list of movies based on Marvel&amp;#8217;s lesser-known properties includes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kick-Ass, Kick-Ass 2&lt;/em&gt; (Icon Comics), licensed by&nbsp;Universal Pictures&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Men In Black, Men in Black 2, Men in Black 3&lt;/em&gt; (acquired from Malibu Comics), licensed by Sony/Columbia Pictures&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kingsmen: The Secret Service&lt;/em&gt; (Icon Comics), licensed by Fox&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Cinematic Flops&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/05/MCM_Licensed_Flops.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2682" src="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/05/MCM_Licensed_Flops-300x206.png" alt="MCM_Licensed_Flops" width="300" height="206" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The list of Marvel mainstream properties that were farmed out to other studios is pretty long, and contains some of Marvel&amp;#8217;s biggest names. Most&nbsp;of these licensed characters never made it to&nbsp;the big screen, and were eventually abandoned by their licensees. Many of them would later reappear in Marvel&amp;#8217;s own movies or TV shows, but some&nbsp;are just&nbsp;sitting around gathering dust.&nbsp;Of those that did make it into theaters, only a very select few were successful. But first, here are the ones that weren&amp;#8217;t:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Artisan&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Artisan Pictures (which has since been bought by Lionsgate)&nbsp;received the licensing rights to make a Black Panther movie, but it never materialized. The movie never seemed to have gotten beyond the casting rumor stages. The license eventually expired in 2005, and was one of the first to return to Marvel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Lionsgate&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lionsgate films obtained two properties from Marvel, though only one of them ever made it into theaters. They received a license for Black Widow but let that license expire unused. The other property they got was Punisher, which was made into two films: &lt;em&gt;The Punisher&lt;/em&gt; in 2004, and &lt;em&gt;Punisher: War Zone&lt;/em&gt; in 2008. These are two standalone movies &amp;#8212; the second is a reboot of the first &amp;#8212; and do not share any continuity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These films are notable for being two of the very few&nbsp;R-Rated movies based on Marvel properties, and the last ones until &lt;em&gt;Deadpool&lt;/em&gt; in 2016. Unfortunately, neither movie was very well-received, and Lionsgate let the license deal expire sometime in 2010, when Marvel announced at SDCC they had gotten the character back. Still, it would be another 6 years before Frank Castle would show up on-screen again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Universal Studios&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Universal Studios made a number of licensing deals with Marvel, including for their theme parks, but only one film property: The Incredible Hulk.&nbsp;This was one of the deals that had been lagging for a long time, possibly as far back as 1990, but was kicked into high gear in the 2000-era success of Marvel&amp;#8217;s characters.&nbsp;They brought in famed director Ang Lee, fresh off &lt;em&gt;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;to convert this into a film, which was released in 2003. The film was rather controversial among Marvel fans, since it changed a lot of the character&amp;#8217;s backstory, but it was commercially pretty successful (not quite making double it&amp;#8217;s budget but coming close). Nonetheless, Universal decided not to follow up on it, and made a deal with&nbsp;Marvel Studios to reacquire the property. Marvel briefly considered making a sequel, before deciding to reboot the character, and to incorporate him into their planned massive movie&nbsp;franchise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One interesting aspect about this deal is that, while Universal can no longer make Hulk movies, they have retained the right to&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;distribute&lt;/em&gt; any Hulk movies that Marvel does make. Several people at Marvel, including actor Mark Ruffalo (the most recent Bruce Banner) have implied that the Disney-owned Marvel will likely not make another solo Hulk movie as long as the distribution rights rest with competitor Universal, but the Hulk is still free to appear in&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; character&amp;#8217;s movies, or the ensemble films.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Sony/Columbia Pictures&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony, via their Columbia Pictures studio, acquired a number of Marvel properties.&nbsp;They were quite successful with one&nbsp;of those (we&amp;#8217;ll get to that), but much less so with the others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They originally had access to Thor and Luke Cage, but were never able to make much progress on either of them and let them pass back to Marvel. Their final property&nbsp;at least got taken to film: Ghost Rider. The 2007 &lt;em&gt;Ghost Rider&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;movie was made enough money&nbsp;to warrant a 2012 sequel, &lt;em&gt;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;but both movies were roundly panned by both fans and critics alike. Sony decided to end the franchise at two movies, and let their license expire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Fox&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of all the studios to get access to Marvel&amp;#8217;s licenses, Fox is far and away the most successful at it. Fox is the only one to even come close to matching Marvel Studio&amp;#8217;s success. However,&nbsp;much like Sony, their one massive success is accompanied by some utter failures. While (as far as I know) Fox actually made movies from all of the properties they licensed,&nbsp;not all of them turned out very well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fox&amp;#8217;s&nbsp;first stumble was with the 2003 movie &lt;em&gt;Daredevil&lt;/em&gt;, which broke a streak of 6 good Marvel&nbsp;movies in a row dating back to 1998, but somehow warranted an even worse 2005 sequel focusing on Daredevil&amp;#8217;s anti-hero girlfriend &lt;em&gt;Elektra&lt;/em&gt;. Fox thankfully stopped at two here, and let the property fall back into Marvel&amp;#8217;s hands, where they promptly turned it into&nbsp;a phenomenal television series.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fox&amp;#8217;s other property hasn&amp;#8217;t done much better: a 2005 adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Fantastic Four&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;wasn&amp;#8217;t bad (certainly not as bad as many other licensed films), but the 2007 follow-up &lt;em&gt;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;seemed to kill the franchise for a while. Fox tried again with the disastrous 2015 reboot &lt;em&gt;Fant4stic&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;[sic, ugh], which was one of the worst-received comic book movies in a very long time. However, at least as of mid-2016, Fox has not yet given up on the property, and there is still talk of a possible sequel (though the planned release date was quickly scrapped).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Cinematic Marvels&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/05/MCM_Licensed_Successes.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2688" src="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/05/MCM_Licensed_Successes-300x223.png" alt="MCM_Licensed_Successes" width="300" height="223" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With that out of the&nbsp;way, lets turn our attention to something much more positive: the resounding success a few studios have had with their Marvel licenses. Overall, there were three distinct&nbsp;Marvel franchises &amp;#8212; each with their own licensee &amp;#8212; that&nbsp;became successful and popular movie adaptations, and brought comic-book movies back into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Blade&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;New Line Cinema has the distinction of producing the first genuinely successful movie franchise based on Marvel&amp;#8217;s property, with it&amp;#8217;s three-film series about Blade, the vampire hunter.&nbsp;The first &lt;em&gt;Blade&lt;/em&gt; film was released in 1998, and was a huge box-office success, spawning not only two sequels, but a short-lived television series set after &lt;em&gt;Blade: Trinity&lt;/em&gt;. The character in the movie was altered slightly from his comic counterpart (he was made into a half-vampire, with the commensurate boosts in strength and speed); after the success of the movie, the Earth-616 Eric Brooks was updated to be more like his &lt;strong&gt;Earth-26320&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;counterpart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first movie was a big hit with comic book fans, and the sequel fared even better, earning more than it&amp;#8217;s predecessor. Unfortunately, in a pattern not-uncommon in comic book movies, after the second film, things started to go downhill.&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Blade: Trinity&lt;/em&gt; was roundly panned by critics, and made less money than &lt;em&gt;Blade 2&lt;/em&gt;. At this point, New Line ran out of things to do with the character, and the final movie was also plagued with personnel issues (largely revolving around star Wesley Snipes). New Line tried to branch out into a television series, but was unsuccessful, and subsequently let the license agreement lapse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blade: Trinity&lt;/em&gt; is notable for being the first of several comic-book movies starring Ryan Reynolds, who would go on to play DC&amp;#8217;s Green Lantern, as well as two different versions of Marvel&amp;#8217;s Deadpool. The series is also notable for all three films being R-Rated, a relative rarity in the superhero world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;While they had pretty bad luck with most of their licenses, Sony/Columbia did manage to make one of their characters into a popular and&nbsp;successful franchise: Spider-Man.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony actually brought out two distinct series of movies for the Spider-Man character. The first,&nbsp;set in &lt;strong&gt;Earth-96283&lt;/strong&gt;,&nbsp;started with &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; in 2002, and produced two sequels,&nbsp;showcasing a number of classic Spider-Man villains, such as The Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom. The movies were initially well received, though there were some key changes in the character&amp;#8217;s backstory. Most notably, Peter&amp;#8217;s first romantic interest is Mary Jane (Gwen Stacy doesn&amp;#8217;t show up until late in the series), and he has organic webbing instead of inventing his own. Unfortunately,&nbsp;each film in the series was slightly less acclaimed (though all of them were commercially successful), and when the director dropped out of the planned fourth movie, Sony already had reboot plans underway to replace it. These films have supplied two of the most infamous scenes in all of comic-book movie history: the classic upside-down kiss from &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;, and the utterly horrible dancing Peter scene from &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2012, Sony released &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;, now set in &lt;strong&gt;Earth-120703&lt;/strong&gt;,&nbsp;which once again told the origin story of the superhero. This version adhered a bit more closely to the comic roots &amp;#8212; Peter invents his webbing and mechanical web slingers, and his love interest is Gwen Stacy. This time, Peter starts off initially facing The Lizard, and the follow-up &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt; pits him against Green Goblin and Electro. Again, the first movie was generally well-received and a box-office success, but the second one significantly less so. After five attempts at a Spider-Man movie (which included plans for a Sinister Six cross-over that never materialized), Sony was finally willing to let the character go.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2015, Marvel and Sony announced that they had finalized a deal to bring Spider-Man into Marvel&amp;#8217;s incredibly&nbsp;phenomenally popular movie franchise. Sony still retains some degree of control over the character, and (similar to Universal and Hulk) will retain distribution rights, but the production aspects of the next Spider-Man movie will include heavy involvement from Marvel, and occur within the shared continuity of Marvel&amp;#8217;s other films.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The X-Men&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;As mentioned, Fox has had, by far, the most success with their Marvel licenses. Indeed, they&amp;#8217;re the only ones who have continued to renew their license deals. Their first big-screen adaptation was the 2000 movie &lt;em&gt;X-Men&lt;/em&gt;, which launched the second most successful Marvel&nbsp;cinematic franchise in history (trailing only slightly behind Marvel&amp;#8217;s own movie franchise.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The X-Men franchise consists of, at present count, nine movies (including the upcoming&lt;em&gt; X-Men: Apocalypse&lt;/em&gt;), with at least a half-dozen more at various stages of development. While&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X-Men&lt;/em&gt; director Bryan Singer has largely driven the creative direction of this franchise, several spin-off movies were produced without him.&nbsp;Unfortunately, this has turned the franchise into possibly the most confusing cinematic universe of any licensee, thanks to a variety of continuity glitches. And now, with the added bonus of time-travel, the &lt;strong&gt;The X-Men Cinematic Universe&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;consists of two separate and distinct &amp;#8220;realities&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The initial series of movies&lt;em&gt;: X-Men&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;X-Men: United&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;X-Men: The Last Stand&lt;/em&gt;, form the core of what Marvel has identified as reality number&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Earth-10005&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;They subsequently released two prequel&nbsp;movies, &lt;i&gt;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&lt;/i&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X-Men: First&lt;/em&gt; Class, plus a second solo movie, &lt;em&gt;The Wolverine&lt;/em&gt;, set sometime after&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Last Stand&lt;/em&gt;. While&nbsp;the&nbsp;solo movie managed to stay pretty consistent with the existing canon (until the very end), the two prequels introduced a lot of problems with continuity, including characters meeting out of order, having unrealistic ages, etc. Fox ultimately&nbsp;attempted to clean up this mess by introducing time travel in &lt;em&gt;X-Men: Days of Future Past&lt;/em&gt;, which didn&amp;#8217;t exactly fix the continuity problems so much as sweep them under the rug. All of those problems still&nbsp;exist in Earth-10005,&nbsp;but that is no longer the &amp;#8220;correct&amp;#8221; reality; all movies from &lt;em&gt;Days of Future Past&lt;/em&gt; forward exist in a new, revised timeline (which Marvel hasn&amp;#8217;t yet assigned a reality number). Singer has explicitly claimed that the events of &lt;em&gt;The Last Stand&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Origins: Wolverine&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;are no longer canon, though no specific mention was made about the other movies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to all the X-Men films, Fox has also branched out into other mutant films; the first of these being the solo&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Deadpool&lt;/em&gt; (notable for being the first R-rated comic movie&nbsp;in 8 years), which is set in the same reality as the current X-Men movies. Fox has also announced plans for a solo Gambit movie, as well as a possible X-Force movie in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Special mention needs to be given to two&nbsp;mutant characters Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. These characters are mutants, and Magneto&amp;#8217;s children, which makes them very closely tied into the X-Men storylines. However, they&nbsp;are also core members of the Avengers team, who&amp;#8217;s license was retained by Marvel. As such, an explicit exemption was built into the Fox deal allowing Marvel to keep using these two characters, as long as no mention is made of their mutant origin.&nbsp;While Fox has yet to use Wanda, they have used (and continue to use) Pietro, meaning there are now two different versions of Quicksilver in two different cinematic universes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Marvel Cinematic Universe&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/05/MCM_MCU.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2700" src="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/05/MCM_MCU-300x253.png" alt="MCM_MCU" width="300" height="253" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2004, after seeing the success that other studios were having with their properties, Marvel&amp;#8217;s new COO decided it was time to begin self-financing movies. Their original project was to make&nbsp;10 movies over 8 years, all distributed by Paramount Pictures, but produced and filmed and financed by Marvel themselves. Marvel still had a ton of character properties that were unlicensed, and movies were planned for characters such as Captain America,&nbsp;Ant-Man, Doctor Strange, and Hawkeye. Pretty soon, however, Marvel began reacquiring rights to properties that had been licensed but unused, starting with Black Panther (which Columbia Pictures let lapse in 2005), Iron Man (from&nbsp;New Line Cinema in 2005), Hulk (from Universal&nbsp;in 2006), and Thor (from Sony, also in 2006). These last three would go on to be the first three movies in &lt;strong&gt;Earth-199999: &lt;/strong&gt;the&lt;strong&gt; Marvel Cinematic Universe&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What immediately set these movies apart was that the MCU was a&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;shared universe.&lt;/strong&gt; Characters and events from earlier movies&nbsp;reappeared in later ones, and the ending scene of each movie teased the next film in the series. This all lead up to one of the biggest movie events in superhero history:&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Avengers&lt;/em&gt;, which brought together four separate solo movie franchises into a single film. Since then, each new Marvel film has built on this shared story, sometimes in big ways (e.g.&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/em&gt;), and sometimes in small ones (e.g.&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Ant-Man&lt;/em&gt;), but always with the goal of telling one single, epic, galaxy-spanning story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2009, Marvel was acquired by Disney,&nbsp;who took over distribution of the Marvel Studio movies when their Paramount deal ended. Disney subsequently bought back the rights to all the existing Paramount films, leaving &lt;em&gt;The Incredible Hulk&lt;/em&gt; as the only MCU movie not wholly-owned by Disney. At the same time, more of Marvel&amp;#8217;s licensed properties kept reverting to them on a steady basis, including ones that had seen big-screen adaptations already: Blade, Ghost Rider, Daredevil, and Punisher. In 2015, Sony Pictures agreed to a restructuring of their Spider-Man license that effectively reverts control of the character to Marvel, meaning that the only Marvel comics franchises that are not under Marvel Studios control are also unfortunately two of their biggest: the X-Men and the Fantastic Four, both still licensed to Fox.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(As noted earlier, Fox also has license deals for Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver; Marvel introduced the Maximov twins in&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt;, but killed off Pietro in that film. Thus, at least at this point, Fox has effectively exclusive use of Quicksilver, and Marvel has effectively exclusive use of Scarlet Witch.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2010, Marvel expanded their movie studios to include television production, brought their Marvel Animation production in-house, and began work on a live-action Marvel television show. &lt;em&gt;Marvel&amp;#8217;s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D&lt;/em&gt;., a spin-off of the &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; movie, was the first live-action Marvel show since the short-lived &lt;em&gt;Blade&lt;/em&gt; series in 2006, and with their renewal for a fourth season, is&nbsp;now second only to &lt;em&gt;The Incredible Hulk&lt;/em&gt; as the longest running&nbsp;such show. Marvel also&nbsp;branched out into online streaming with a series of Netflix-based programs, with &lt;em&gt;Daredevil&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Jessica Jones,&lt;/em&gt; plus the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Luke Cage&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Iron Fist&lt;/em&gt;, culminating in&nbsp;a planned crossover show &lt;em&gt;Defenders&lt;/em&gt;. They also produce &lt;em&gt;Powers&lt;/em&gt;, a show exclusive to the Playstation Network.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of this moment, the Marvel Cinematic universe is, by a very large margin, the most successful film franchise in history; with another dozen films on the books for the next few years and at least one more TV show, it shows no signs of slowing down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Animated Shared Universes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like the DCCM, Marvel&amp;#8217;s cinematic multiverse has been home to a huge number of animated programs, which I have largely ignored here for space reasons. In general, the majority of those shows are&nbsp;set in their own separate universes. However, there have been two sets of animated TV series that are set in shared universes, and deserve special mention:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth-8096&lt;/strong&gt; is a&nbsp;shared continuity&nbsp;consisting of several animated films and television series that aired between 2009 and 2012, including &lt;em&gt;Hulk Vs. (2009), Thor: Tales of Asgard (2011),&nbsp;Wolverine and the X-Men (2009), &lt;/em&gt;and&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Earth&amp;#8217;s Mightiest Heroes (2010-2012)&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, there were two limited-edition runs&nbsp;of print comics spun off of&nbsp;from the latter program that are set in the same universe. In 2012,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Earth&amp;#8217;s Mightiest Heroes&lt;/em&gt; was cancelled, thus ending the Earth-8096 story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth-12041&lt;/strong&gt;, the &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Marvel Animated Universe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;, is&nbsp;the shared universe where all of Marvel&amp;#8217;s currently active (and a few finished) animated series take place. It began upon the cancellation of the last Earth-8096 show, and the creation of&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Marvel&amp;#8217;s Avengers Assemble&lt;/em&gt;. The shows in this universe more closely follow the tone and characterizations of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though the actual plots and storylines are drawn from multiple comics sources.&nbsp;At the moment, the universe includes the animated series&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Marvel&amp;#8217;s Avengers Assemble (2013-), Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H (2013-2015), Ultimate Spider-Man (2012-), &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Marvel&amp;#8217;s Guardians of the Galaxy (2015-)&lt;/em&gt;.&nbsp;As with Earth-8096, most of these&nbsp;shows now have spin-off print comic series, also set in the same shared universe&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, extra special recognition needs to go to&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Hero 6&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; an animated film based off an obscure Japanese superhero team from Earth-616. Not only is this the first (and only, so far) animated Marvel movie to be released into theaters, it&amp;#8217;s also the first Marvel-based film to win an Academy Award (for Best Animated Feature).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;First off, I&amp;#8217;d like to thank everyone who&amp;#8217;s helped me with this, including, but not limited to everyone who helped choose shows, everyone who voted and predicted, &nbsp;&lt;a href="http://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/1148/jack-b-nimble" target="_blank"&gt;Jack B Nimble&lt;/a&gt; for all the blog stuff and especially,&nbsp;&lt;a href="http://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/31394/rand-althor" target="_blank"&gt;Rand al&amp;#8217;Thor&lt;/a&gt;, for helping me, giving positive feedback and defending this entire event multiple times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now, the results!

Bold means the show is still in the running.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firefly&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nu-Who&lt;/strong&gt;:&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic&lt;/strong&gt;:&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daredevil&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batman: The Animated Series&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Star Trek: The Original Series: 1&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now, on to The Great Science-Fiction/Fantasy TV Showdown, Round Two!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After thinking about it for a long time, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to arrange the surviving shows in an attempt to prevent steam-rolling. This may not not be entirely &amp;#8220;fair&amp;#8221; but I argue it gives better data on what shows are more popular among our user-base. For example, everyone knows that&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Firefly&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is far more popular than&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Time&lt;/em&gt;, but as of now, we don&amp;#8217;t really know whether&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Supernatural&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;are more popular.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Heavy Contenders #1:&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;b&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nu-Who&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Heavy Contenders #2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;b&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dave Filoni:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;Star Wars: The Clone Wars &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC Animated:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;Justice League Unlimited &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;Batman: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marvel VS DC:&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flash &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;Daredevil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science Fiction with&nbsp;Numbers in their Names:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;Babylon 5 &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;Stargate: SG-1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#80&amp;#8217;s:&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transformers &lt;/em&gt;(Original) and&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;TMNT &lt;/em&gt;(Original)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animation Across the Nations, 2.0 Edition:&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Futurama &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;MLP: Friendship is Magic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Old School:&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hitchhiker&amp;#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy &lt;/em&gt;(Series) and&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;Quantum Leap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;90&amp;#8217;s and Beyond:&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left-Overs (Part 1):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;Farscape &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;The Twilight Zone &lt;/em&gt;(Original)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left-Overs (Part 2):&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sabrina the Teenage Witch &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;Supernatural&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s too late to predict, but you can still vote for Round Two!

    &amp;#160; If there&amp;#8217;s one thing science-fiction and fantasy fans like more than watching, reading and playing science-fiction and fantasy, it&amp;#8217;s arguing about watching, reading and playing science-fiction and fantasy.

Marvel vs. DC. &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;. Classic Who vs. NuWho. These debates may very well rage on for the rest of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But now, The Science Fiction and Fantasy Stack Exchange is going to what they can to help settle these debates. Every month or so (hopefully), we&amp;#8217;ll host a bracket, where all members of the site will be able to vote in order to determine the best of the science-fiction and fantasy best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This month, we&amp;#8217;re doing science fiction and fantasy TV shows. I, with help from other members of site, have selected 48 science fiction and fantasy TV shows from across the decades. These 48 shows were chosen by popularity and notability, and range the full spectrum of sub-genres and fan-bases. I have arranged them to hopefully prevent any round one steam-rolling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So without further ado, arranged in no particular order for the primary bracket, the shows!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trek Yourself Before You Wreck Yourself: &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Original Series /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not Your Children&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8217;&nbsp;Cartoons: &lt;em&gt;Futurama /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fun For All Ages: &lt;em&gt;Adventure Time /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; My Little Pony Friendship is Magic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Family That Slays Together: &lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; Angel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who Are You? Who, Who, Who, Who?: Classic Doctor Who / Nu-Who&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Element Of Surprise: &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; The Legend of Korra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mysteries And Stuff: &lt;em&gt; LOST /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; X-Files&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batman V Batman: Dawn of Batman: &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; (‘60s) / &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What A Twist!: &lt;em&gt;The Twilight Zone&lt;/em&gt; (Original) / &lt;em&gt;The Outer Limits&lt;/em&gt; (Original)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jedi Did Not See That Coming: &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Clone Wars /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; Star Wars: Rebels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turtle Power!: &lt;em&gt;TMNT&lt;/em&gt; (Original) &nbsp;/ &lt;em&gt;TMNT&lt;/em&gt; (2012)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Spoilers!: &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space And Stuff: &lt;em&gt;Battlestar Galactica (2004) /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DC on CW: &lt;em&gt;Arrow /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; The Flash&lt;/em&gt; (2014)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This IS A Place For A Hero: &lt;em&gt;The Spectacular Spider-Man /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; Justice League Unlimited&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aussies and Brits: &lt;em&gt;Farscape /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; Red Dwarf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply Marvelous: &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; Daredevil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently Airing Fantasy: &lt;em&gt;Supernatural /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; Once Upon a Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spin-Offs: &lt;em&gt;Stargate: SG-1 /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; The Sarah Connor Chronicles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Classics: &lt;em&gt;The Incredible Hulk&lt;/em&gt; (1978) / &lt;em&gt;The Hitchhiker&amp;#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; (TV series)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animation Across The Nation(s): &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt; (1984) / &lt;em&gt;Gravity Falls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty Funny: &lt;em&gt;Sabrina the Teenage Witch /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; ALF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;T&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5"&gt;ime After Time: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Quantum Leap / &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Torchwood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There Are Two Left Over And I Can&amp;#8217;t Think Of Any Connection But They Both Start With F, So Let&amp;#8217;s Go With That:&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style="line-height: 1.5"&gt;Firefly /&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em style="line-height: 1.5"&gt;Fringe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to choosing the most popular series, there also a chance for &lt;em&gt;you to win.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;During the first week of the event, everyone will have the opportunity to choose the show they think will be the most popular.

    &lt;blockquote&gt;Spoiler-filled analysis from the point of view of one who reads comics, not who reviews movies.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally ran on &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ebonstorm/batman-v-superman-not-a-review-dcaa5efc416a#.d2kdknvyx"&gt;medium.com&lt;/a&gt; and was reposted here with the permission of Thaddeus Howze&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/03/batmanvsuperman.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/03/batmanvsuperman.jpeg" alt="batmanvsuperman" width="1200" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2579" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the record. I hate writing reviews. Why? Because criticism is easy. Any idiot can sit in a theater and have an opinion. Any art critic can, with the weight of their degree in art literacy, define why a thing fails to deliver whatever THEY think it should deliver to an “audience.” As a writer who struggles to find that proper beat to put a story to while I am writing it, I am always reminded movies are a special breed of writing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Movies are a collaboration. They are a story written by at least one person, massaged by two or three other people, edited by another person before being turned into a script which gets changed daily. As the shots are reviewed and then taken from different angles, all that work is gathered together and digitally enhanced, cinematic effects added, CGI constructs placed and then this beast is edited down to fit a designated time pattern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is one of the most important parts of a movie’s creation: No matter what vision a director might have, arbitrary decisions made as to what stays in and what goes out are often made by executives whose reasons for doing what they do are completely their own but presumably were meant to make the film more “profitable,” based on some movie-making algorithm only they understand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-2578"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While we may blame the director, we have no idea of what forces may play upon him while he works. Directors are the weathermen, the executives who run the company are the weather…certainly at times, tempestuous and unpredictable. &lt;a href='http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Here-Why-Joss-Whedon-Says-He-Directing-Avengers-Infinity-War-70816.html'&gt;Ask Joss Whedon why he isn’t making any more Avengers movies…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Often, what you see in a final cut of a movie is what’s left, after the magic smoke has escaped out the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After the ideas of the writers were parsed away, after the script strips away more life, after the limitations of shooting, the integration of CGI and the final edit do their work, what might have been envisioned is now a melange of scenes apparently stuck together without the connective tissue decorating the cutting room floor; (figuratively speaking since movies are entirely digital these days…)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s left is a highly processed monstrosity, which maybe has enough flavor for you to see what was meant to be a four-course meal and instead is now a bento box, barely palatable, filled with food you don’t recognize and aren’t sure you want to eat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Movies are a group event requiring the efforts of hundreds or even thousands of people. Movies are like computers; most of us have no idea what goes into them, how they work, or what kinds of science was required to make them function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We only know when they don’t work, it pisses us off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hence, reviews don’t impress me. Because it is easy to say what you don’t like, don’t think worked, and how this effort should cause everyone to lose their jobs and never work again, without understanding that a thousand people poured two or three years of their lives into this thing you casually dismiss with nothing but a word. I stand by that wisdom taught to me when I was six: “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To business:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I liked this movie. A lot. It could easily walk away with a 6.5 to 7/10 for me. Yes, there are issues, but EVERY movie has them. It was hardly the worst thing ever made in the superhero movie-making business. &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287978/"&gt;See: Daredevil (2003)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a movie, in its way, designed to be a love letter to comic fans everywhere. Alas, without the proper knowledge of the lore, the movie will be a complete miss for everyone else. As I see it, there will only be two camps, people who will love it or people who will hate it. I hope critics promoting their hatred doesn’t stop people from going to see it and judging for themselves. For those of you who have the lore, the understanding of the totality of the DC Universe, there will be something here for you. For those of you without said lore and without the understanding, NOTHING in this movie will make any sense to you, no matter how many art degrees you possess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sorry. If I had known, I would have warned you. Fans, and you know who you are, you will be okay. Hopefully DC will have learned from this experience and will try a bit harder to make their movies understandable for everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here there be spoilers — read no further if you haven’t seen the movie and hate to be spoiled. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I need to start this Not-a-Review with the words of my autistic 12 year old who wears his love of Superman and Batman on his sleeve: “After all of that, all we ended up with is a dead Superman?” He was profoundly disturbed. He couldn’t understand why Superman and Batman were fighting. But he didn’t like it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was hard to argue with his analysis. And if you were a non-comic person, you likely came away with the very same thought. I saw the movie with my son who loves superheroes but has none of the lore and my wife who is an above average study in comics by proxy and also found it enjoyable. But I could see the movie’s subtle charms, its hidden or maybe even lost potential, cut away, perhaps only to appear in the Blue-ray version, thus while many will spit in my eye and say I am a fool, I think this movie was worthy. It had faults, but most movies do. I prefer my movies to err on the side of reaching too far than to not reach far enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Batman v Superman wanted too much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It wanted to be all things to all people not realizing most people who are watching superheroes films as they are currently being created, are not ready for this kind of film. People expected this movie to follow the Marvel formula: * Pick a simple idea, dress it up well, make it funny, keep it focused on movement and like three card monty, keep the viewers guessing until the end. * Don’t make them work too hard because you want to keep the frustration low. Give them a happy ending with a cute video bon mot tacked on at the end of the movie. This is the Low Hanging Fruit Protocol of Superhero movie development. * And the damn thing works. It works because it is simple. It explains nothing, you just follow the brightly colored heroes until the movie ends. You don’t try to figure out why Stark is funny, why Thor is loud, why Hawkeye carries a USB virus on an arrowhead and can place it right the first time. (How many times does it take YOU to plug in a USB drive?) You just accept that they do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Batman v Superman is not that film. It was ambitious. Too ambitious. It wanted, more than anything else to redeem, what is considered the first failure of this director, Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel, by putting the events of the movie in context with the perspective of Humans on the ground. It tried to reach into the psychology of helplessness felt by people when an event too great for them to understand suddenly changes their world forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was nothing wrong with this idea. This is an attempt of the writers of the DC Universe to bring our current worldview, our fears, our politics, our resistance to change, into the comics. Should we be doing that is a different question, but you cannot fault them for considering it. In fact, superheroes do this exact thing decade after decade if you pay attention to them long enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While I am not a fan of Superman or Batman killing people, there is a precedent for both characters doing so in the past and while we are not privy to the ultimate nature of this DC Universe (I’ll explain later) it is not outside of the context of possibility for both characters, no matter how much the &lt;a href="http://cbldf.org/comics-code-history-the-seal-of-approval/"&gt;Comic’s Code Authority&lt;/a&gt; sanitized them for generations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This movie wanted to exploit our fear of a wider, unknown universe. In this case, the Kryptonian spaceships raining death from the skies, all over the planet. Our technology was helpless to stop them. At our current stage of development, we were simply unable to protect ourselves. Imagine the fear the social unrest this must have caused worldwide: 9/11 times 1,000!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One day we’re the masters of the Universe, creating technologies, messing with science, engaging in worldwide commerce, the next day, we are nothing more than ants running from some super-powered threat destroying our anthill with a wave of their hands and the flash of their eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But they look just like us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a real fear, something I fully expect the Human race to discover if and when extraterrestrials make their appearance. Humanity is undone, our greatness forgotten in the light of a more powerful, nearly godlike being’s presence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Batman v Superman tries to explain a complicated Batman, a grizzled veteran who has experienced great losses, at least one dead Robin, presumably at the hands of the Joker, and a history of at least twenty years of being Batman, becoming slightly unhinged in the process. His psychological disturbance playing out and being manipulated several times in the movie. Each tweaking of his mind acting as part premonition, part psychological manipulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those keeping score, the savior scene when he is lifted up by the bats and the demonic scene as his parents graves leak black blood and a demonic creature leaps forth. These were not dreams. These were manipulations to convince Bruce Wayne’s tortured mind only he could save humanity from the threat of demonic encroachment. What was missing was context.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This Bruce Wayne is not Batman as we know him. He is no pacifist. No bleeding heart unwilling to take a life. This Batman is cruel, branding his enemies, in effect judging them and marking them for death in prison. This Batman shoots guns, takes a beating, sucks it up and asks for seconds. His fighting style employs terrorizing his enemies into submission, spooking crook and police alike.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This Batman is inspired by the Arkham Batman video games. His fighting is fast, brutal and in several cases, deadly. I can see one confrontation with this Batman, should you survive, to be all a criminal needs to consider a life on the straight and narrow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ben Affleck was almost unrecognizable in his role as Batman, having taken it to heart, beefing up, and working to make himself a presence on the screen. I could have done without the origin retelling but I forgave it when they used it later in the movie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are two other parts of the movie where Bruce is experiencing what I believe to be either telepathic communication or some other form of mental manipulation. The Flashpoint hint is sheer genius and completely out of left field leaving the audience to ask: WTF was that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;By showing what appears to be a Flashpoint call out, the possibility is planted that this timeline, the one we are viewing is, in fact, NOT DC’s main timeline. Which DC Multiverse world is this one? Is it one of many?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;In fact, comic readers know DC has/had at least 52 timelines where they have their stories taking place. We are not privy to which one these movies take up or how they relate to the DC television multiverse which has at least three separate worlds: The Flash/Arrowverse, deemed Earth-One, Jay Garrick’s Earth-Two, and Supergirl’s Earth which has not be designated but is presumably NOT the same Earth as the Arrowverse.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;In most of the DC Universes we knew prior to this one, Superman and Batman have been, more often than not, good friends; the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Finest_Comics"&gt;World’s Finest&lt;/a&gt;, in point of fact.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pbDSWWLmegr3noE8_qzPvA.jpeg' class="aligncenter " /&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Superman is highly respected and has the friendship of the Justice League. He is the first hero to show up and inspire others, not the last to arrive and reveal his powers…&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Are what we are seeing the remnants of some reshuffling of the DC Universe? Was the Flash warning Bruce of an impending disaster or was this universe the result of that disaster? The implications of that one scene would be lost on someone who didn’t know what &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashpoint_%28comics%29"&gt;Flashpoint&lt;/a&gt; was…&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_2461" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RyhAJNUtTupYw8iplRT5kA.jpeg' /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In the Flashpoint Universe, our favorite heroes are different, maybe even a bit terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second Bat-Dream is of an impending Apokalips (not a mis-spelling) and the Superman-logo wearing troopers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;I recognized it for what it was but if you weren’t a comic reader you had no idea what you were seeing.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Once the scene is in full swing, the parademons were a wonderful touch. I suspect Desaad or some other entity to be responsible for these transmissions/manipulations but whatever their source (Metron, perhaps) they show a future Earth under the complete rule of Darkseid…&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Again, completely disjointed, apparently removed from the current story arc. Or is it?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What if it was part of the manipulation hinted at by Luthor at the very end. Luthor implies the dinner bell has been rung and HE is coming. What if Luthor hadn’t been alone in his planning? Was it indeed possible, Luthor was not the only mastermind here, but an agent of a greater, wiser and far more insidious power.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This certainly wouldn’t be the first time we have seen this idea. An Elseworlds series showing &lt;a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Kal-El_%28Earth-1198%29"&gt;Superman from Earth 1198&lt;/a&gt; is raised by Darkseid instead of the Kents. It has even been played out again recently in the New 52 stories of Earth 2, where Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman were killed in a world wide invasion by Darkseid. Superman (Kal-El) is later resurrected and plays for the other team. These scenes are not accidental. They are trying to set up a larger story in the future of the DC Extended Universe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Batman v Superman wants you to believe the annoying character of Lex Luthor was somehow able to manipulate Bruce Wayne, his employees, his company, not only once but at least three times to create a stage where:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Batman would live in fear of Superman, playing on his fears created with the psychological assist of an unknown enemy (likely the technologically-sophisticated mental torture of Darkseid’s favorite chew toy, Desaad.)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;This would have, in theory helped to further destabilize Bruce Wayne’s mental state, noticed only by Alfred, who makes his notice of this clear with his speech about the cruelty of fearful men, escalating that fear tipping Wayne’s already unhinged psyche to murderous levels.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ultimately manipulating him into threatening a being who should be able to crush him like a bug.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;While “losing” the only substance which could make it possible for Batman to defeat Superman in a fight. Arranging the information so that Batman could find it, hunt it down, attempt to take it and leave it conveniently accessible to him. (Are you telling me Luthor not only doesn’t jam outbound communications from his secret lairs he doesn’t even have a cell phone jammer for his minions? These were breadcrumbs for Batman to “find” and secure the Kryptonite to destroy the alien menace of Superman…)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;This implied Luthor was exercising an intellect simply unparalleled and unclouded by anything other than his desire to be rid of one or both of his enemies. In an ideal world, he would be rid of Superman and could kill Batman at his leisure. Without the timely intervention of Lois Lane, he would have had his wish. Assuming this was his plan in the first place and not Darkseid’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Batman v Superman reveals a wondrous Wonder Woman who is apparently VERY long lived, (allowing her to have a history spanning ALL of the 20th century, which was a nice touch). While I could not place any of the other faces with her in the 1918 photo, I had the impression I had seen them or their analogs somewhere. I am certain someone will name them soon. I suspect one of them is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Trevor"&gt;Steve Trevor…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wonder Women is no wilting flower either. She is bold, fearless and maybe just a little too into fighting for her own good. I had the impression she hadn’t fought anything or anyone who could give her a run for her money in quite some time. Perhaps the underworld hadn’t lost any monsters since the turn of the century. Despite my dislike of Godot for the role, she managed to make me believe she COULD be Wonder Woman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The movie falls down around the idea that Lex Luthor (whom most of us have over the decades been conditioned to believe was composed, urbane and a sophisticated intellect) could be played by an actor most of us don’t associate with such a role. I admit to being distracted by his awful clothing, his annoying anecdotes, and that simply awful goddamn hair. All of this just kept taking me out of the role. Is it the actor’s fault? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe the script didn’t do its job to present Luthor as both insane and brilliant in a way I could believe. When I look for insane and brilliant I think of Sir Anthony Hopkins, Hannibal Lector. The composure of the character belied the monster within. Jesse Eisenberg just didn’t bring that gravitas I was hoping for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, the idiosyncratic behavior displayed by this Luthor rubbed most fans the wrong way so much so, we hate to admit his plotting and scheming to get Batman to kill Superman included Batman stealing the very Kryptonite, Luthor managed to “secure” in the first place. Luthor’s manipulations were just a bit TOO subtle and thus most people don’t immediately understand almost every event we saw was likely manipulated by him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kudos to the capitol building scene. This was simply a brilliant coup; a dark, goddamn devastating scene where the pieces come together and the world’s most powerful individual must simply stand there without any idea of what to do. The monstrousness of the act reveals Luthor’s nature as a petty, spoiled, psychologically unbalanced but brilliant mind. He toys with everyone in that scene distracting them with the weighty question of “Who Watches the Watchmen?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can’t unhinge Superman physically. You unhinge him mentally. Luthor’s play was excellent. Superman can’t show himself without having to explain himself. He is temporarily undone, forced into hiding giving Luthor time to complete his plan. The conversation with his dead father? A lift from the comics as well. (I have to find the screenshot but trust me, it was a shout out to that conversation. Was it necessary? Maybe, maybe not. I suspect it was to provide a reminder that every action has consequences, even when we think we are doing something good.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had mixed feelings about Lois Lane. Luthor manipulates her but how could he have depended on her gaining access to the bullet fragment? How could he know? Was his operative so good he would know to shoot her book to leave the “evidence?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The photographer with her turns out to be CIA (I thought he was Jimmy Olsen) and was surprised to see him shot dead in the scene. Raised a bunch of questions for me:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Jimmy Olsen was CIA?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Does that mean the CIA technically knew Clark Kent was Superman? Or at least suspected it?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Why wasn’t Lois more aware of Jimmy (assuming this was Jimmy’s apparent cover?) Why didn’t she investigate THAT while she was at it?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Did she tell Clark what happened to Jimmy or who he worked for? Surely it should have come up in conversation?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lois always felt a step behind the curve and that annoyed me more as the movie progressed. I also didn’t like the handling of the terrorist who had the gun to Lois’ head. It seemed extreme, like something Injustice Superman might have done. What happened to finesse? Heat vision? Supercold breath? I mean Superman flew him through two brick walls. Surely he couldn’t have survived? Overkill much?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe this is the problem I had with the entire movie. It seemed as if it were trying to be Injustice (an Elseworld type story where the Justice League goes rogue and conquers the world under the rule of Superman) but just kept coming up short.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best supporting role goes to Alfred, whose biting commentary, many skills and awesome effectiveness overall, made him a part of the Batman mythos in a way rarely seen in the comics. Definitely an upgrade to the character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fight between Batman and Superman was well scripted and it pretty much showed both Batman’s ingenuity and Superman’s superiority, physically speaking:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;It also highlighted Superman’s lack of creativity for problem solving since he rarely has to do more than show up for problems to BE solved.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Overall, with a shitload of planning and preparation, Batman could take a Superman who wasn’t trying to kill him.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A Superman who wanted to kill him would have turned him and his nice Bat-armor into a puddle of molten metal.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;For me, the weakest part of the movie was the Doomsday reveal. Doomsday was pathetic in his appearance, as if they ran out of Playdoh and CGI artists who gave a damn. We handwave away the Kryptonian ship being left in the center of Metropolis…:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;What were they thinking?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Who leaves an alien artifact of incredible power and potential scientific knowledge right in the middle of the city where it fell out of the sky?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How about explaining that for the viewing public. It would have taken just a throwaway line: “The Kryptonian spaceship was insert description here (too large, too massive, too fragile) to move and was thus left in the center of the city as the lesser threat…”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;We somehow accept and handwave away Luthor gaining access to it and figuring out how to utilize the technology:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Kryptonians had a 100,000 years of space travel, with the resources of thousands of worlds, and a database chock-full of technologically advanced capabilities which could destroy any civilization lacking any ethical or moral compass:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Were the Kryptonians stupid enough to believe fingerprint biometric capabilities were all you needed to access their technology?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Why didn’t the government workers think of doing exactly what Luthor did?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;And how does adding Luthor’s blood make Zod’s body an abomination?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Why didn’t Luthor resurrect Zod since it appears the Kryptonian ship had the ability to resurrect dead tissue? Hint, hint…&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Was all of the resurrection technology being shown to us to hint at the fact Superman may only be “mostly dead?”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, Doomsday was a cut-rate Abomination (see Hulk movie) or cave troll, (Lord of the Rings). His singular claim to fame is killing Superman. The very least they could do is make him look impressive, which they failed to do. The fight between the three of them was pretty much what I expected, ending with the only outcome that made any sense. I was glad to see Superman try and take the fight out of the city almost immediately, showing he had learned his lesson where fighting people as powerful as he was is concerned. Surviving the nuke was a nice touch (and a call out to the Dark Knight Returns) without the drawing energy out of the plants handwave…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given all of my other minor issues with the movie, I still would give it a 7 out of 10, maintaining the overall tone of the previous movie while trying to inject a bit of hope of something greater in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have Darkseid to look forward to, we have Flashpoint hinted at, and the formation of the early members of a Justice League as well as a potential Wonder Woman stand alone movie. All in all, I say, despite the critics who might lack the information necessary to follow all of the stories shoe-horned into this movie and thus may not be able to follow the movie successfully, the movie did its best to reach the fans who knew the materials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That effort was a double-edged sword. While sending out mad-love to the fans, the movie alienated the normal, non-superhero fans who have little to no knowledge of the heroes or their respective mythos. This ability to draw in the common viewer is why Marvel has proven to be more successful. Marvel takes a single thread and plays it out so even if you barely know who anyone is, you can feel somewhat connected, though they did better in Avengers than they did in Age of Ultron.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel like DC can still pull success out of this movie and the DC Entertainment Universe is off to a rich, kinda crazed start. I can forgive this mess with the understanding DC is working from fear of being outstripped by Marvel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC Entertainment my advice to you is simple:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Run your race. Stop looking at Marvel. Their path is not yours.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Simplify your stories, get new writers and directors who love your history. Use your history to tell stories. Find the stories people loved and give them new life on the big screen.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You’re acting as if you don’t have anything to share with a movie audience. It’s simply not true. Young Justice is still the best rendition of the DC Universe ever created. The Animated Adventures of Superman, Batman and the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited were the best superhero stories to consistently appear on television for a decade.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To quote the writer/editor/creator Joseph P. Illidge: “Stop being afraid of your history. You are the realm of imagination. Act like it.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After watching a few random episodes of &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; over the previous several years (I saw the 2006 Christmas special live on TV, and then a selection of episodes from Series 4 and 5 around Christmas 2011), I started to get seriously into the franchise around Christmas 2014, and now consider myself a fully fledged Whovian, having watched over two-thirds of all New Who episodes in not much more than a year. Series 9, the most recently released, was the first &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve watched week by week while it was coming out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The series was largely well received, having been hailed by various critics as &lt;a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/30174?m=26054008#26054008"&gt;the best Moffat season yet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/198?m=26046419#26046419"&gt;the best since Eccleston&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href="http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/12/12/doctor-who-season-9-review"&gt;the best season of New Who&lt;/a&gt;. Personally I think Series 4 is still my favourite New Who series, but I did very much enjoy this new one, and Capaldi could now give Tennant a run for his money as my favourite Doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This series contained more multi-episode stories than any other for a long time. This allowed more time for each story to develop, mature, and conclude without feeling overly rushed; on the other hand, it detracted from the self-containedness that many of the best &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; episodes have, and made it harder for casual viewers to &amp;#8216;drop in&amp;#8217; for just a single episode.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jenna Coleman secured the title of the longest-serving Companion of New Who towards the end of this series before her eventual departure. Peter Capaldi has now really settled into his role as the Doctor, bringing some of his own flair to the show and ensuring his place in the annals of Whovian history. In Series 8 he had to spend too much time acting grumpy and proving that he wasn&amp;#8217;t Matt Smith, but now he&amp;#8217;s been able to spread his wings, let his hair down a bit, and establish himself as (in my view) the best speech-making Doctor in all of New Who. Oh, and speaking of hair, was I really the only one to notice the swap in hair length between the two main characters?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_2530" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/03/DW-series-8-9-bigger.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-2530 size-medium" src="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/03/DW-series-8-9-bigger-300x155.jpg" alt="Hair in series 8-9" width="300" height="155" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Good hair day or bad hair day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now without further ado, let&amp;#8217;s start on the episode-by-episode summaries. Naturally, &lt;strong&gt;SPOILER ALERT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-2525"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Episode 1: The Magician&amp;#8217;s Apprentice&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;As an episode with historical significance for the show, this has its merits: the &lt;a href="http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/103257/have-these-two-doctor-who-characters-ever-met-before"&gt;first-ever episode featuring both Davros and the Master/Missy&lt;/a&gt;, the latter&amp;#8217;s mysterious return to the show, some interesting backstory for the former (I still get a chill when thinking about the final line of the cold open: &amp;#8220;Davros. My name is Davros.&amp;#8221;). As the first episode of a series &amp;#8211; the one which should be a gentle introduction for people who&amp;#8217;ve never seen the show before &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s pretty bad. Anyone who doesn&amp;#8217;t know who Davros is (which includes some regular viewers, if not any true Whovians) wouldn&amp;#8217;t get the point of the pre-credits scene; anyone who&amp;#8217;s unfamiliar with Missy or the Daleks would be lost throughout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much of this episode feels like pointless filler just to get an episode&amp;#8217;s worth of material. The whole business of the planes stopping is unrelated to the main story, just a plot device to bring Missy back into the fray. The Doctor&amp;#8217;s dramatic entrance, riding on a tank and playing a guitar, is a typical Moffatism: so &amp;#8220;awesome&amp;#8221; that it&amp;#8217;s right on the edge of crossing into &amp;#8220;ridiculous&amp;#8221;. (And if he&amp;#8217;d said &amp;#8220;dude&amp;#8221; one more time, I would&amp;#8217;ve &lt;em&gt;screamed&lt;/em&gt;.) Eventually the main story kicks off, when the trio &amp;#8211; the trio? hang on, why is Missy even hanging out with our heroes? &amp;#8211; for some reason accept a ride from Davros&amp;#8217;s henchman rather than taking the TARDIS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By now there&amp;#8217;s not much time left in the episode: just enough for Davros to play some old &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; clips to the Doctor while Missy and Clara find themselves on &amp;#8211; &lt;em&gt;cue dramatic music&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Skaro. The cliffhanger ending is so dire that it seems almost ridiculously contrived just in order to have a cliffhanger (that Moffatism again). Clara dead, the TARDIS destroyed, the Doctor possibly a killer &amp;#8230; let&amp;#8217;s hope the next episode manages to resolve all these problems in a reasonably believable way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favourite quote:&lt;/strong&gt; Missy gets all the good lines this time. It&amp;#8217;s a toss-up between:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Try, nano-brain, to rise above the reproductive frenzy of your noisy little food chain, and contemplate friendship. A friendship older than your civilisation, and infinitely more complex.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No, wait, hang on a minute. &lt;em&gt;Davros&lt;/em&gt; is your arch-enemy now? I&amp;#8217;ll scratch his eye out.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Episode 2: The Witch&amp;#8217;s Familiar&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;What this episode lacks in terms of adequately resolving the last episode&amp;#8217;s cliffhanger (whoops! Missy and Clara not dead after all; whoops! TARDIS easily rematerialised), it makes up for with a good deal of deep conversation between Davros and the Doctor: far more interesting to watch than the cheap quips and banter of the previous episode. The two parallel storylines &amp;#8211; Missy and Clara making their way back in from the desert; Davros and the Doctor sparring together &amp;#8211; mesh together reasonably well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Missy and Clara&amp;#8217;s initial conversation (complete with shots of the First/Fourth/Twelfth Doctor in an off-screen adventure) gives us an interesting little insight into the Doctor&amp;#8217;s mind, and if you listen carefully it also explains how Missy survived her apparent death at the end of Series 8. Later on we learn something new about how Daleks work, their every action translated by their tank into gunfire and cries of &amp;#8220;Exterminate&amp;#8221;. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure this contradicts previous canon, but, well, that&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; for you. And was I the only one to think immediately of the film &lt;em&gt;The Italian Job&lt;/em&gt; when Missy&amp;#8217;s final scene ended?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The episode&amp;#8217;s centrepiece is the conversation between Davros and the Doctor, setting the stage for what I feel is one of the main themes of this series: showcasing Capaldi as perhaps the greatest speech-making Doctor ever. The game of strategy between the two old enemies goes deep as first one then the other gains the upper hand. Finally, just when Davros seems to have secured his victory, the Doctor turns out to have been (as usual) pulling the strings all along. As the city collapses around them, he brings back the TARDIS using &amp;#8230; wait for it &amp;#8230; sonic sunglasses. Ugh. Millions of Whovians just threw their hands up in disgust. We&amp;#8217;ve known and loved the sonic screwdriver for years, and replacing it by some &amp;#8216;wearable technology&amp;#8217; just feels like a betrayal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favourite quote:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s no such thing as the Doctor. I&amp;#8217;m just a bloke in a box, telling stories. And I didn&amp;#8217;t come here because I&amp;#8217;m ashamed. A bit of shame never hurt anyone. I came because you&amp;#8217;re sick and you asked. And because sometimes, on a good day, if I try very hard, I&amp;#8217;m not some old Time Lord who ran away. I&amp;#8217;m the Doctor.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Episode 3: Under the Lake&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;This has all the elements of a classic &amp;#8220;base under siege&amp;#8221; episode, which &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; has been doing well for decades: a small, clearly defined cast and set; an insidious, poorly understood threat; and no means of escape. As usual there&amp;#8217;s a slightly obnoxious &amp;#8216;money man&amp;#8217; &amp;#8211; Pritchard &amp;#8211; but while such characters often end up surviving just to show it&amp;#8217;s not always the most likeable ones who live (e.g. in &lt;em&gt;Voyage of the Damned&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Silence in the Library&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;Forest of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;), this time he&amp;#8217;s one of the first to be killed. The rest of the crew consists of two men and two women, and don&amp;#8217;t worry: the shippers will be satisfied!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In typical Twelfth Doctor fashion, the Doctor at first pooh-poohs the idea of ghosts, saying there&amp;#8217;s no such thing &amp;#8211; apparently forgetting all the dead souls returned that he&amp;#8217;s encountered before, most recently the Cyberghosts in the Series 8 finale. When he finally comes to accept it, his childish enthusiasm is on the edge between amusing and ridiculous. (The &amp;#8220;nice things to say&amp;#8221; record cards that appear in this scene, on the other hand, are simply ridiculous.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quickly it becomes clear that the ghosts have some sort of master plan which involves killing again and again to increase their numbers. The Doctor orders a quarantine, effectively sealing them all in, and masterminds the plan to capture the ghosts. For a moment it feels more like fantasy or horror than scifi, with &lt;em&gt;the dark, the sword, the forsaken, the temple&lt;/em&gt; being some kind of words of power. But once they&amp;#8217;re decoded, we&amp;#8217;re back to sci-fi with submarines and spaceships and suspended animation chambers. Cass and the Doctor are in the middle of working out the whole scheme when the base starts to flood, and just as happened in Series 3&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;base under siege&amp;#8221; episode &lt;em&gt;42&lt;/em&gt;, the Doctor is cut off from his Companion. The cliffhanger ending arrives along with what appears to be the Doctor&amp;#8217;s ghost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favourite quote:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s OK. I understand. You&amp;#8217;re an idiot. [&amp;#8230;] Sorry, why is this man still talking to me?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Episode 4: Before the Flood&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;For a show that&amp;#8217;s supposed to be all about time travel, &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; actually has surprisingly few episodes in which time travel plays a role in the plot: this and the series finale being the only such episodes in Series 9. This episode is also unusual in its breaking of the fourth wall. The first scene is the Doctor explaining to us, the viewers, about bootstrap paradoxes: a common concept in time-travel fiction and one which has come up before in &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt;, most famously in the episode &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt;. I was OK with this break with tradition, except for the thrown-in advertisement for &lt;a href="http://www.obrigadopelospeixes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/tumblr_nw1rlbMo0A1ru83j3o8_400-1.gif"&gt;a certain search engine company&lt;/a&gt;. It also inspired this awesome picture (originally sourced from the &lt;a href="http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-10/doctor-who-what-is-the-bootstrap-paradox"&gt;Radio Times&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_2539" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/03/Capalthoven.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-2539 size-medium" src="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/03/Capalthoven-300x181.jpg" alt="Pedtwig van Capalthoven" width="300" height="181" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The composer Petdwig van Capalthoven&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back in 1980, in a Soviet-style town, we finally meet the undertaker for real. Played by the inimitable Paul Kaye (of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Jonathan Strange &amp;amp; Mr Norrell&lt;/em&gt; fame), he provides a little much-needed comic relief to this otherwise rather dark episode, before his mysterious and entirely expected death. The plot thickens as the Doctor&amp;#8217;s ghost turns out to be mouthing something different from the others &amp;#8211; our first clue that it&amp;#8217;s not just another ghost. The old theme of the Doctor facing moral criticism from his human companions, much more prevalent in Old Who than it is today, resurfaces here when Bennett accuses him of having allowed O&amp;#8217;Donnell to die.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As might be expected in an episode based around a bootstrap paradox, the narrative is quite hard to make sense of. Does the Doctor actually change the past, or does he not? It took me a while to work out, but it all makes sense provided you&amp;#8217;re OK with certain ideas having no clear origin. The Fisher King &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; create the writing to turn Prentis, Moran, Pritchard, and O&amp;#8217;Donnell into ghosts, and the events of the previous episode &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; part of its evil scheme just as we thought (it was only the Doctor&amp;#8217;s ghost that wasn&amp;#8217;t), but it was destroyed in the flood and never took its place in the suspended animation chamber. It&amp;#8217;s one of those episodes that you need to spend a while puzzling over after you finish watching, but worth the effort. Oh and just like I promised, all the shippers are satisfied at the end: we have Bennett-O&amp;#8217;Donnell for those who like tragic romances, and Cass-Lunn for those who prefer happy ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favourite quote:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&amp;#8220;Off the map. Out of the rule book. What if I don&amp;#8217;t die? What if I refuse? I&amp;#8217;m going to go back to the base and I&amp;#8217;m going to save Clara, because that&amp;#8217;s what I do. And I don&amp;#8217;t see anyone here who&amp;#8217;s going to stop me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Episode 5: The Girl Who Died&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several of this season&amp;#8217;s episodes start with the Doctor and Clara just emerging from, or talking about, their previous (off-screen) adventure. This is in contrast to episodes in the RTD era, which usually started with the TARDIS materialising somewhere and the Doctor and his Companion jumping straight into their latest adventure. The idea is presumably to show just how much time Clara spends with the Doctor &amp;#8211; not just the adventures we see on-screen, but untold dozens in between &amp;#8211; so that the scale of his grief at losing her at the end of the series makes more sense. The actual story here is straightforward: Doctor shows up, human village under threat from alien warriors, all seems lost, Doctor miraculously saves the day using unexpected resources and a strong team effort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the episode is to introduce an important recurring character for this series: Ashildr. For those who weren&amp;#8217;t following the rumours that Maisie Williams&amp;#8217;s character was going to have a significant role, this was made clear by the Doctor&amp;#8217;s reaction to her in her first few moments on the screen. Although most of her character development comes after this episode, the way we view her changes significantly here too: from the warrior maiden declaring war on the Mire, to the semi-outcast who&amp;#8217;s always been different from the others, to the frightened girl who loves her home and her friends, this is someone the showrunners have put an unusual amount of effort into characterising.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We also get a nice case study of the Doctor. This is when he&amp;#8217;s always at his finest: put him in what seems to be an impossible situation, with what seems to be a bunch of useless people, and watch him use every last scrap of the resources available and force everyone to play to their strengths and bring out their inner talent. After his inevitable victory, the fate of the one-off Companion is taken beyond &amp;#8220;she dies saving the day&amp;#8221; (a la &lt;em&gt;Voyage of the Damned&lt;/em&gt;) to &amp;#8220;she apparently dies and comes back to life&amp;#8221; (a la &lt;em&gt;The Doctor&amp;#8217;s Daughter&lt;/em&gt;), and even a step beyond that since her coming back to life is an issue in itself: it makes her a new kind of creature, an anomaly like Jack Harkness. And as part of what spurs the Doctor to save her, we get something we&amp;#8217;ve never had before: an explanation for where he got one of his faces. Another moment with historical significance for the show as a whole.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favourite quote:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&amp;#8220;No, no, not Vikings! I&amp;#8217;m not in the mood for Vikings!&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;(It doesn&amp;#8217;t sound very funny here, but the tone and facial expression with it made me crack up.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Episode 6: The Woman Who Lived&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is what they call a Companion-lite episode; Clara is basically absent throughout, except for a short scene at the very end. It&amp;#8217;s also, despite what some of the internet will tell you, almost completely separate from the previous episode. The issue of whether or not they&amp;#8217;re officially considered a two-parter is &lt;a href="http://movies.stackexchange.com/q/50655/27759"&gt;complicated&lt;/a&gt;, but the stories being told are entirely different and linked only by a single character, who also appears in other episodes towards the end of the series. Once again, the main purpose is to explore Ashildr&amp;#8217;s character, and the actual story is even less interesting than the previous episode&amp;#8217;s: attempted invasion of Earth by big cat aliens, thwarted at the last minute by using their own technology against them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s obvious straight away that Ashildr (I&amp;#8217;m going to keep on calling her that) has greatly changed since we last saw her. No longer going by the same name, no longer seeming to care about the village where she grew up, this callous and aloof woman is a far cry from the innocent girl we met last time. And it&amp;#8217;s clear almost from the start that she&amp;#8217;s not telling the Doctor everything, which heightens our mistrust for her. She&amp;#8217;s a fascinating study in what immortality &amp;#8211; never growing old, losing everyone you love, but always continuing on &amp;#8211; can do to a person. As she herself points out, she&amp;#8217;s similar to the Doctor in this respect; the difference between the two lies in how they deal with the problems of an extended lifespan. The exploring of powerful moral issues like this, which lead us to respect the Doctor on a deep level, are one of the things I love most about the show.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sam Swift initially seems to be nothing more than comic relief (bad comic relief at that, with some quite terrible jokes), but he ends up at the very centre of events. As with several one-off &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; characters, the showrunners leave the option open for him to appear again, by not resolving the question of whether or not he&amp;#8217;s as immortal as Ashildr after being killed and brought back to life. Ashildr, on the other hand, establishes herself as a recurring presence in the Doctor&amp;#8217;s life and leaves us almost certain that she&amp;#8217;ll turn up again, and in a way more significant than simply a background figure in photos of Clara. As indeed she will &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favourite quote:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&amp;#8220;Ashildr! He doesn&amp;#8217;t care.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;But I do. Oh, God, I do. I actually do. I, I care.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Welcome back.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h1&gt;To be continued &amp;#8230;&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the more intimate experience at FanX 2016, I was able to attend several celebrity panels. Here are some notes from these experiences. Included here are Levar Burton, Alan Tudyk, Chandler Riggs, Gillian Anderson, and Kate Beckinsale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Levar Burton&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;After receiving the first three questions in panel, which were all relating to Reading Rainbow, he made a comment that the people in Salt Lake City were a lot more sophisticated than those at other conventions. About half of the questions in the 50 minute session were focused Reading Rainbow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The TV mini-series Roots has been remade and will be released Labor Day weekend. 4 two hour parts with 4 different directors. Levar Burton, a producer of the mini-series (and star of the original series), said it was an amazing feeling to be working on the project 40 years after making the first one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: Why didn&amp;#8217;t you have more relationships on TNG?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Burton: I don&amp;#8217;t know. I mean, I think I&amp;#8217;m a decent looking guy. Every member of the crew had sex on that ship, except for me. Even the android.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: The Leah referenced in &amp;#8220;All Good Things&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;, was that Leah Brahms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Burton: Yes.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-2549"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: Which is better for Star Trek, TV or movies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Burton: Yes.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: How do you feel about the new Star Trek movies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Burton: JJ Abrams did an amazing thing to the franchise. On the other hand, he created a timeline where my character may no longer exist.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Alan Tudyk&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alan Tudyk announced that they were going to start work on Con Man Season 2 on March 28th, 2016. He also said there is a four part comic book coming out for Spectrum, the TV show his character Wray was a part of in Con Man. He described it as the fictional comic book series which inspired the fictional book, which inspired the fictional TV show. He said book number one is available on Free Comic Book Day on May 7th.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also started he had just finished a pilot for a new DC TV show called &lt;em&gt;Powerless,&lt;/em&gt; which is a comedy series about an insurance company in the DC Universe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: Is there anything you can tell us about Rogue One?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Tudyk: I can&amp;#8217;t say anything, because if I do, when I get back to my hotel room my computer will start pinging me, and then I&amp;#8217;ll hear from Disney.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;I can say this though, there is a scene where a few of us are just sitting around eating fudge. For about an hour. Half of the movie is us just sitting in a room eating fudge.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#8217;t been to a panel with Alan Tudyk, he brings a bag of miscellaneous items with him. When someone asks a question he takes something from the bag, signs it, and gives it to the questioner. Some of the items given were:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cover page to the pilot script of Powerless&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Firefly Walsh action figure cardboard backing (the figure and plastic were missing)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A doily from a hotel room&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A ticket to a Broadway play he saw recently&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Chandler Riggs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You might know him as Carl from &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: What is your favorite episode/scene [of The Walking Dead]?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Riggs: Episode 16, which doesn&amp;#8217;t come out for another week. [Episode 16 is the season finale of Season 6].&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: How is your relationship with Judith?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Riggs: It is hard because we&amp;#8217;ve had something like seven sets of twins for Judith, because they keep growing up&amp;#8230;For awhile my job on the show was just to hold Judith and try to keep her from crying.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I guess this means that Carl is allowed to age on the show, but Judith isn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Gillian Anderson&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anderson was wearing a shirt with a meme joke from a recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel. At the end of the panel she auctioned it off with the proceeds going to &lt;a href="http://www.taughtnottrafficked.com/"&gt;Taught NOT Trafficked&lt;/a&gt;, a program that helps protect children in Nepal from being trafficked and forced in exploitative situations. The final bid for the shirt was $1,000.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: Was it ever scary on the set of the X-Files?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Anderson: No. Because on the set you see the wires and the makeup and everything and it isn&amp;#8217;t scary. Reading about it can be scary though. I quickly learned to read the scripts during the day.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: What was the creepiest episode for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Anderson: I don&amp;#8217;t know. The evil cat episode? Where I was attacked by an evil cat, or maybe it was a bunch of cats?&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: Did you ever feel Scully should have started believing [in the supernatural]?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Anderson: I called up Chris [Carter] after a few years and said &amp;#8220;Are you [expletive] kidding me? I mean, are you [expletive] kidding me?&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Chris told me that without that dynamic the show wouldn&amp;#8217;t work, so Scully had to continue being that way.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Kate Beckinsale&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kate Beckinsale was mostly prompting her upcoming movie Underworld 5.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: I&amp;#8217;m a dentist. I wanted to say you have very nice teeth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Beckinsale: Thank you! I&amp;#8217;m the only person in England to ever have their teeth come down straight.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These quotes may not be exact quotes, as I had to quickly scribble down the questions and responses. The salient details are correct.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn&amp;#8217;t perfect by any means, hampered by an increasingly meandering story as it went on and a finale that dropped the ball in a multitude of ways, but as an introduction to this new part of the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe? It did a good job of setting the tone for the rest of the Netflix shows, something followed up by and capitalised on by the significantly better &lt;i&gt;Jessica Jones&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the second season of &lt;i&gt;Daredevil&lt;/i&gt; fails to reach the heights set by &lt;i&gt;Jessica Jones&lt;/i&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s still an improvement over the first season in nearly every way &amp;#8211; primarily thanks to the way that show-runners Doug Petrie and Marco Ramirez seem to have listened to and acted on criticisms of the first season. The most obvious strength that the second season has over the first is also the most simple &amp;#8211; the second season of &lt;i&gt;Daredevil&lt;/i&gt; has enough going on to actually justify it&amp;#8217;s length.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are two fairly distinct stories at play in the second season of &lt;i&gt;Daredevil&lt;/i&gt;. The first sees the introduction of fan-favourite character Frank Castle (also known as The Punisher) to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a murderous vigilante who is terrorising Hell&amp;#8217;s Kitchen as he seeks revenge for the death of his family at the hands of criminals. The other sees Matt reunite with Elektra Natchios, an old girlfriend from Matt&amp;#8217;s time in college who is significantly more dangerous than she may appear at first glance.&lt;span id="more-2505"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;re both good storylines in their own ways, used to show us different parts of who Matt is and how he sees the world &amp;#8211; but it&amp;#8217;s obvious that the Frank Castle side of things is the more interesting of the two. Whereas Elektra is just another side character for Matt to interact with (and not a particularly well-developed one at that, despite the best efforts of actress Elodie Yung), Frank acts as an entirely separate viewpoint into the season, more like a secondary protagonist than anything else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it works incredibly well &amp;#8211; Frank actually ends up being the most interesting character that the show has produced so far thanks to some excellent writing that really dives into the psychology of the character, a handful of truly brutal action scenes and a phenomenal performance from Jon Bernthal. This is the definitive version of The Punisher, and I&amp;#8217;d watch a show centered around him in a heartbeat &amp;#8211; but I have to admit that I&amp;#8217;d rather see him co-star in future seasons of &lt;i&gt;Daredevil&lt;/i&gt;, simply because his uneasy relationship with Daredevil and the ideological differences between them help make Matt less boring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because I think we need to admit that Matt was a little boring in the first season. It was fairly interesting seeing him trying to consolidate his vigilantism with his conscience, day job and faith, but it also made him a little too brooding for my taste. And although that&amp;#8217;s still somewhat true here, the Matt we meet in the second season is simple more confident in himself, and over the course of the season we grow to realise one very important thing about him &amp;#8211; he absolutely loves beating people up, a character flaw that bites him in the ass towards the latter half of the season but also makes him significantly more fun to be around. Take the incredibly impressive stairwell fight sequence towards the end of the third episode for example &amp;#8211; a little laugh to himself just before the fighting starts tells us everything we need to know about who Matt Murdoch really is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also more interesting this season are both Karen and Foggy, who spent most of last season trying to solve a mystery that both we the audience and Matt himself already knew the answer to. &lt;i&gt;Daredevil&lt;/i&gt; makes no such mistake this time around &amp;#8211; other than one instance where Karen finds out some information just minutes before it is all revealed anyway, they both have their own stories independent of Matt&amp;#8217;s adventures, the resulting being that they both really develop as characters over the course of the season. For Foggy, that means learning that he has value outside of his relationship to Matt (which is pretty meta considering some of the reactions that people had to him in the first season), and although Karen&amp;#8217;s is a little harder to define without entering the realm of incredibly vague spoilers, I will say that I enjoyed the way that it used one of the more controversial aspects of the first season to its advantage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only real flaws that &lt;i&gt;Daredevil&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#8216;s second season suffer from are those relating to the way that various storylines conclude. The overall ending to the big mystery of the season doesn&amp;#8217;t really make much sense, and the season finale hinges around being invested in a huge fight sequence against an organisation whose unclear goals mean that they never really seem all that threatening &amp;#8211; but even then &lt;i&gt;Daredevil&lt;/i&gt; kind of makes it work, the execution of each conclusion being good enough to get away with the fact that it doesn&amp;#8217;t quite feel right and could have done with a rewrite or two. And that says it all really &amp;#8211; by the time the season finale came around, I was so invested in what was going on that I was willing to deal with a substandard conclusion simply because of how good that which came before had been.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There just isn&amp;#8217;t an area where the second season of &lt;i&gt;Daredevil&lt;/i&gt;&nbsp;doesn&amp;#8217;t improve on the first, and if the almost inevitable third season can continue that trajectory we could be looking at something really special. The action is better, the stories more engaging, the characters more interesting &amp;#8211; hell, we even get more time with Nelson and Murdock actually being lawyers, another example of the show seemingly listening to criticism and trying to act on it. So I&amp;#8217;ll say just this in my attempt to influence the third season of the show &amp;#8211; can we please get a proper visualisation of Matt&amp;#8217;s radar sense?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh, and fix the costume already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="http://screennerds.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"&gt;ScreenNerds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;IMDB&amp;#8217;s description:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Blair, a fighter pilot, joins an interstellar war to fight the evil Kilrathi who are trying to destroy the universe.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_2461" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/02/wingcommander.1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/02/wingcommander.1.jpg" alt="This jacket cover makes the movie sound pretty exciting, so I&amp;#039;m optimistic. They definitely aren&amp;#039;t allowed to misrepresent a movie on its cover. " width="850" height="570" class="size-full wp-image-2461" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This jacket cover makes the movie sound pretty exciting, so I&amp;#8217;m optimistic.&lt;br /&gt; They definitely aren&amp;#8217;t allowed to misrepresent a movie on these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The opening credits say based on the games and novels by Chris Roberts. Then it says directed by the same Chris Roberts. Video game design and making movies are basically the same, so I&amp;#8217;m sure in hindsight this will be viewed as the good decision it obviously is. You don&amp;#8217;t want to bog down a film production with a director who has experience or a proven track record.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The movie opens with some exposition that mankind was conquering space and everything until they ran into a race of aliens called the Kilrathi and now they are in a desperate war against them. On the space station Pegasus, it is business as usual, until a Kilrathi fleet comes out of nowhere and easily destroys all the ships and boards the station. Their target? The computer that allows humans to travel through space. The CO of the station tries somewhat comically to shoot and smash his way into the computer room to prevent it from falling into enemy hands, but to no avail. Instead he sends out a little distress pod and goes down with the station. The Kilrathi now have access to the CO&amp;#8217;s computer! Let&amp;#8217;s hope there wasn&amp;#8217;t anything inappropriate on there&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now we cut to a small cargo ship, the Diligent. This ship has a crew of one old guy (Tchéky Karyo) named Taggart and two rookie pilots being transported to their first assignment in deep space. The two pilots are Lt. Blair (Freddie Prince Jr.) and Lt. Marshall (Matthew Lillard). Wing Commander is the second of what is apparently five match-ups of Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard. Matthew Lillard, of course, having his acting career destroyed by Scooby Doo movies, and has subsequently spent the last 12 years of his life doing little else other than rehashing the character Shaggy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-2431"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Diligent gets a message from Earth command to deliver a mission assignment to the Tiger Claw, which is convenient, because they were headed there anyways. Old Man Taggart gives the com to Marshall, who immediately screws up and pilots them too close to a blackhole or something. Lucky for them (and us, I guess) Blair is some half-breed human / spaceborn gravitational genius, and in less than 10 seconds he is able to plot a course that takes them right to the Tiger Claw. Blair&amp;#8217;s mother was something called a Pilgrim, and because of that, he has crazy navigation powers, or something. Also, the Pilgrims seem to be generally hated by everyone except Taggart. Despite this, Blair seems to go out of his way flashing his Pilgrim badge of honor all over the place. This is probably because he doesn&amp;#8217;t want any friends. Unfortunately for him this tactic doesn&amp;#8217;t work on Marshall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Diligent meets up with the Tiger Claw and Taggart delivers the orders. The secret assignment is the Tiger Claw is basically on a suicide mission to delay the Kilrathi fleet, set to arrive at Earth in 23 hours, for at least 2 hours, so that the human fleet, set to arrive back in the Sol System in 25 hours, has time to get there. The captain doesn&amp;#8217;t believe these orders are real, and neither does the XO (Jürgen Prochnow), until Taggart gives the captain a ring from his finger. Now the captain believes everything! So I guess this is the ring of truth or something. Yes. It rings true.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marshall and Blair start aimlessly wandering around in the ship. Blair decides to climb into what must be the worst spaceship fighter in the galaxy, and then Lt. Cdr. Deveraux (Saffron Burrows) shows up and yells at him. Marshall and Blair then head to the pilot&amp;#8217;s area where Blair immediately decides to flash his Pilgrim bling again, which almost starts a fight. Marshall is able to sooth things over with some alcohol, and everyone becomes friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_2459" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/02/wingcommander.4.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/02/wingcommander.4.png" alt="Blair the Idiot hits on his commanding officer. " width="720" height="304" class="size-full wp-image-2459" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blair the Idiot hits on his commanding officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now it is time for a mission. Deveraux teams up with Blair to go on a recon mission in which they &amp;#8220;must not be detected.&amp;#8221; You&amp;#8217;ll never guess what happens though. The enemy detects them and Blair shoots a couple of Kilrathi fighters. They return to the Tiger Claw and get chewed out, I guess it would have been better if they had died. While on the mission they did discover a large communications ship. Blair decides to visit Deveraux in her cabin (weird?) and she tells Blair the reason she was so hard on him when they met was because he was sitting in the fighter of a recently deceased pilot that she had a relationship with. Somehow this pilot died but they recovered his intact fighter. Meanwhile Marshall used this downtime to immediately hook up with another pilot named Forbes (Ginny Holder).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, remember that communications ship? The Tiger Claw scrabbles all but two fighters to go hunt down said ship and destroy it. But wait! This is actually a Kilrathi trap and the Tiger Claw is going to get it! Somehow Taggart (who is inexplicably in a fighter on this mission) realizes this and convinces Deveraux to pull the team back to the Tiger Claw (turns out he is secretly military intelligence). Cut to the Tiger Claw as they suddenly lose their two fighter escort and are now in a pitched battle. The captain is just sitting around doing very little while the XO coordinates the attack. He is the kind of XO who likes his ship to take a ton of damage before he fights back, and the Kilrathi oblige him. Things aren&amp;#8217;t looking good for the Tiger Claw, but then those other fighters show up again and there is a decent enough space battle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After blowing up a few Kilrathi ships the Tiger Claw is in retreat and Deveraux orders all fighters back. Marshall and Forbes don&amp;#8217;t listen though, because they are in a constant game of one-upmanship. Forbes does a daring game of chicken with a Kilrathi fighter before destroying it to prove how great she is. Marshall does an even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; daring game of chicken which results in the Kilrathi crashing into Forbes. Forbes&amp;#8217; ship is pretty damaged and the ejection seat doesn&amp;#8217;t work. Marshall tries to guide her in and she crashes just outside the force-field between space and the interior of the ship. Ultimately Deveraux makes the call to push the wreckage out of the way so the other ships can land. Marshall is pretty broken up about a girl he met perhaps 10 hours ago and goes catatonic for awhile (but not actually too long, because this movie has to wrap up within a 25 hour time window). Deveraux comes down on him pretty hard, but Blair convinces her they need him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Kilrathi have regrouped and now the Tiger Claw (due to heavy damage needlessly sustained) must hide in the shadow of a crater. The XO orders all power to be cut and for everyone to be quiet. Then you see a ship slowly passing over and you hear the ping of.. sonar? The ship passes over and begins bombing the shadows. So, this movie seems to think that space is like the ocean, and ships need to act like submarines. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure sound only carries over a medium (like water, or air) and not through the empty vacuum of space. One online review said this submarine nonsense was a homage to &lt;em&gt;Das Boot&lt;/em&gt;, because Jürgen Prochnow was in that movie doing the exact same thing. That&amp;#8217;s great, but why is it in &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; movie?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Down by the hanger a hole gets punched in the ship and air starts to get sucked out (oh wait, we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in space?!). Blair starts to get pulled towards the breach and everyone is like &amp;quot;yeah let him die because he&amp;#039;s a Pilgrim or whatever.&amp;quot; Marshall manages to rally the gawkers just standing around in the hanger and is able to save Blair and close the breach. Blair goes back to Taggart and asks him why everyone hates Pilgrims. Turns out Taggart is also a Pilgrim! Taggart says the Pilgrims thought they were better than everyone else and the universe hates them for it. Sounds legit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_2456" style="width: 675px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/02/wingcommander.2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/02/wingcommander.2.jpg" alt="Maybe they hate him for being a Pilgrim. Or maybe it is because of the stupid expression he wears on his face the whole movie. " width="665" height="209" class="size-full wp-image-2456" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Maybe they hate him for being a Pilgrim. Or maybe it is because of the stupid expression he wears on his stupid face the whole stupid movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The silly submarine attack is over, and the Tiger Claw is in even &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; shape. They ain&amp;#8217;t got no fuel cells, and I reckon that ain&amp;#8217;t good. But they&amp;#8217;ve detected that communications ship, and it probably has fuel cells. The Diligent (remember it?) is apparently still around and undamaged, so they load all the pilots into space suits to launch a boarding party against the Comm ship. I guess pilots make great marines. They manage to board the ship and Blair single-handedly kills about a dozen Kilrathi, which we see for the first time are kind of like giant cats. Could this war has been averted with a few huge balls of yarn? We&amp;#8217;ll never know the truth. Anyways, Blair finds that Nav computer that was taken at the very beginning of the movie (which revealed the location of Earth of the Kilrathi) and learns where they will make their entry into Earth&amp;#8217;s solar system. The other boarders are able to steal some fuel cells. It&amp;#8217;s a good thing Kilrathi Comm ships and Terran carriers use the same battery size (DDDDDDDDDD). Also the Kilrathi were able to use the Nav computer without difficulty. Technology in this universe is crazy compatible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_2458" style="width: 757px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/02/wingcommander.3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/02/wingcommander.3.jpg" alt="Just out looking for Catnip in the stars. " width="747" height="329" class="size-full wp-image-2458" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Just out looking for Catnip in the stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now they have successfully delayed the Kilrathi enough, because now it isn&amp;#8217;t a question of delaying them anymore, but of getting the intel back to the fleet so they can wipe out that Kilrathi extermination fleet. I say this because the human fleet is now lying in wait around Venus waiting for the Kilrathi to show up. The Tiger Claw is too jacked up to make the trip, but a couple of fighters might make it, but only if they take a shortcut through a pulsar or some nonsense. Deveraux and Blair are chosen. Blair, because he can make magic with jump points to get them there crazy fast, and Deveraux, because nobody trusts that filthy Pilgrim anyways. As they leave the Tiger Claw is attacked by some kind of teleporting torpedo, and Deveraux abandons the mission of &lt;em&gt;saving Earth&lt;/em&gt; to stop it. Her ship is subsequently ruined and she is left in a pod drifting in space. A fitting end for a species traitor like her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blair makes the jump to Earth and sends the intel, but he was followed! Remember that black hole thing at the beginning of the movie? Apparently it is in our solar system, because Blair then does some crazy gravity dive towards it and lures the Kilrathi pursuit vehicle to its death. Now the Kilrathi fleet starts showing up one ship at a time and the Terran fleet mops them up like fish in a space barrel. The Tiger Claw shows up and Deveraux was saved (Boo!). Blair and her reunite and they start kissing. Even though Deveraux just lost someone close to her a few days ago. Love travels fast in space (but not sound!).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;IMDB&amp;#8217;s description:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;In the future, Highlander Connor MacLeod must prevent the destruction of Earth under an anti-ozone shield.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s pretend Highlander II: The Quickening is a stand alone movie and isn&amp;#8217;t a sequel to a Cult Classic. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The movie opens in the &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt; setting of 1999. Apparently the Earth&amp;#8217;s ozone is gone and people are dying by the millions, including MacLeod&amp;#8217;s wife. On her death bed she makes him promise to stop that terrible burden on society called &amp;#8216;The Sun&amp;#8217; no matter it what it takes. Flash forward a little bit and MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) is now leading a team of scientists. They appear to have successfully built a death ray to finally give the sun a taste of its own medicine. Oh wait, I guess it is a planetary shield. Well, same difference for the Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-2409"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flash forward to maybe 25 years later (there is a plaque that says &amp;#8217;25 years under the shield&amp;#8217; but was that plaque just placed there this year?) MacLeod is an old man dozing in a theater. Suddenly he hears a disembodied voice in his head and experiences a flash back. Apparently MacLeod comes from another planet in another galaxy, some 500 years ago. There is a group of rebels and Ramirez (Sean Connery) gathering in a bombed out ship. They appear to be on some kind of crappy desert planet named Zeist. Ramirez goes on about how they finally can complete their rebellion and no longer have to suffer through it leaderless (all this time they didn&amp;#8217;t have a leader?). He draws a sword and points to the crowd and says &amp;#8216;there is your leader.&amp;#8217; Now, my impression is that he was just hoping one of the people won&amp;#8217;t turn around. As luck should have it MacLeod doesn&amp;#8217;t, and is proclaimed leader of the Rebellion. Ramirez goes through some weird ritual with MacLeod that bonds them together on some sort of energy level, and then they are attacked. MacLeod, the new leader of the rebellion as of five minutes ago, leads his troops to destruction and they are killed to a man save MacLeod and Ramirez, who are taken prisoner by General Katana (Michael Ironside).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;p&gt;MacLeod and General Katana exchange some pointless banter about how much they hate each other, and then the courts sentence MacLeod and Ramirez to a life of immortality on a far away planet named Earth. Apparently they are being sent there to acquire a prize (of which only one person can claim) and then the winner can choose to either die of old age or return to Zeist. They are promptly teleported away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_2427" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/02/highlander2.2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/02/highlander2.2.jpg" alt="Council of Idiots" width="600" height="248" class="size-full wp-image-2427" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Council of Zeist (or whatever they are called).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flash back to old MacLeod, who goes to a bar to drink away the pain. From this we determine that MacLeod won the prize and decide to remain on earth and die, possibly because of his dead lady friend. Did you know that shield he created blocks out the sun and made the whole earth hot and super humid? I&amp;#8217;ll bet the Earth&amp;#8217;s plants sure thought that was a sucky compromise, along with all the humans who probably starved to death when all the plants died. Anyways, now the Earth is in perpetual nighttime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jump over to a group of terrorists breaking into the Shield Generator. Is there goal to destroy it? Apparently not, they just want to know what the weather is like above the shield. Turns out the ozone layer is fine. Thirty seconds later the terrorists are running for their lives and one of them is a woman. She manages to escape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jump back to the planet Zeist. For some reason the council is heckling General Katana that MacLeod is still alive and hasn&amp;#8217;t returned. Anyways, Katana decides to send two identical henchmen to Earth to finish MacLeod off. One of these idiots even points out to the General that MacLeod will likely die of old age in a matter of weeks. The General doesn&amp;#8217;t care, even though he has waited 500 years, 500 years and 3 weeks it too long. Given what we&amp;#8217;ve seen of the planet Zeist, staying on Earth is the smart choice (at least pre-&lt;em&gt;MacLeod screwed over the Earth with a shield&lt;/em&gt; Earth). The aliens appear to immortal on their planet too, so I&amp;#8217;m not sure why they made a point of saying the exiled guys will be immortal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_2426" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/02/highlander2.1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/02/highlander2.1.jpg" alt="One of two identical idiots sent to kill MacLeod." width="600" height="248" class="size-full wp-image-2426" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;One of two identical henchmen sent to kill MacLeod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The woman, named Louise Marcus (Virginia Madsen) somehow stumbles upon MacLeod while he is drinking his sorrows away and being harassed by some woman for building a life saving (but world destroying) shield. He happened to cut his hand and it instantly healed, which he was sad about. She says she&amp;#8217;s been trying to get a hold of him and has admired him her whole life. Seems kind of weird, but whatever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While they are outside suddenly the two Zeist twins show up and one of them attacks MacLeod, this sequence of random running around literally takes over eight minutes until MacLeod manages to decapitate his attacker with a train. Then MacLeod receives a jolt of lightning (The Quickening) and is made young again. Then the other Zeist twin attacks him. MacLeod steals a hoverboard and the two fly around for another ten minutes until the twin is also decapitated. MacLeod goes over to a shocked Louise, and tries to explain, but when that fails they randomly have sex up against a building in this filthy city. This literally happens like 10 seconds after battle ends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MacLeod heads to the Shield Corporation and gets in because he still has his own fingerprints. He talks to some old white guy, who says &amp;#8220;that was forty years ago.&amp;#8221; So it was 40 years and not 25 years ago? This means every Wikipedia page I&amp;#8217;ve looked at that says the movie is set in 2024 is wrong. Anyways, he gets kicked out of the building when the CEO (John C. McGinley) doesn&amp;#8217;t want to hear about an ozone layer that exists. Somehow the shield which &amp;#8220;saved&amp;#8221; all life on the planet is a money making corporation, and not a government funded entitlement on life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh, while MacLeod was fighting he starting randomly saying Ramirez&amp;#8217;s name, and lo and behold Ramirez materializes on a stage in Scotland. This might be why people called MacLeod the Highlander, but because we are pretending this is a standalone movie, we don&amp;#8217;t know why. Rameriz steals a sword from the stage (which I&amp;#8217;m guessing is a non-functional prop) and then uses one of his earrings to pay for a new suit and fly to New York City.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile General Katana sees that his idiot plan to send more people to Earth and make MacLeod immortal again has backfired and decides to go himself. He arrives inside a subway car and proceeds to go to the front, turn it up to 700+ units of velocity (maybe we&amp;#8217;ll be on KPH by 2024, err 2039). This kills everyone in the train car, except Katana. Then the train car emerges from the subway at a not very fast speed, and Katana wanders off. I&amp;#8217;m just going to paraphrase all of Katana&amp;#8217;s pointless actions throughout the movie. He harasses a cabbie and a bunch of other people. He meets with MacLeod in a church and they can&amp;#8217;t fight because it is holy ground. He eventually goes to the head of the Shield Corporation and allies with the CEO to take down MacLeod.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_2428" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/02/highlander2.3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/files/2016/02/highlander2.3.jpg" alt="My name is General Katana. I am neither Japanese nor do I wield a katana. " width="600" height="248" class="size-full wp-image-2428" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;My name is General Katana. I am neither Japanese nor do I wield a katana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;So MacLeod, Ramirez, and Louise break into Shield Corporation. The two men use their immortality to just drive in and get shot up while Louise hides in the trunk. Then they are all three taken to the infirmary (this facility has both a private security force authorized to use deadly force AND an infirmary, and yet the city at large doesn&amp;#8217;t appear to have a police force). The trio get into some stupid room with a stupid spinning fan, and Rameriz uses some magic to hold the fan up and open a door, and then disintegrates. So Rameriz is a magician, and MacLeod can bring people back from the dead, or something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then MacLeod is finally able to fight General Katana, MacLeod wins, and then uses the Quickening to destroy the shield, bringing an end to this nightmare that MacLeod created (both the movie and the shield).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wait, was this movie supposed to be a cautionary tale of our future if we don&amp;#8217;t stop polluting? Because if so, the message is the Earth will fix itself if we just leave it alone for a few years. Good to know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting Tidbits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you watched the movie on Hulu (or somewhere else) today, you wouldn&amp;#8217;t see any mention of the planet Zeist. Apparently a few years after this disaster of a movie came out, they went back and touched up some of the special effects, changed the sequence of events, and re-shot a few scenes to completely remove any mention of the planet. In the new version, General Katana sends MacLeod and Rameriz into the future. This makes even less sense than an alien race banishing people to Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In preparing for this review I watched the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; version on Hulu, but also looked up YouTube videos to see the original (which is what I saw on VHS back in the day). I also used several Wiki websites to fill in a few gaps. That being said, as noted above, there are some errors on those Wiki pages (surprise!).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to one video review I watched, Sean Connery has only reprised two roles in his entire career. He reprised his role of James Bond, and he reprised his role as Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lets go back and say this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a sequel to a Cult Classic. In the original Highlander, the story is largely centered around the police detectives attempting to figure out who is killing people in New York and cutting off their heads. In this movie, there is no indication that police even exist anymore. It is basically the same as in the first season of Heroes, you see the FBI trying to stop the serial killer Sylar, but by season 2 I guess they don&amp;#8217;t care anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
