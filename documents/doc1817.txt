       <div class="excerpt_main"> 
        <div class="post-text"> 
         <p>Imagine someone has a question about physics, say “How can I figure out the acceleration due to gravity?”</p> 
         <p>A physicist answers with “You can throw a bowling ball from various floors of a multistorey building.” The physicist knows in their head the experiment they would perform. It’s so obvious to them that they skim over the details and say what they see to be the key points, and assume that the person asking will figure the rest out.</p> 
         <p>The problem with this is that a non-physicist has asked the question, and they don’t know the details that the physicist skimmed over. If they did, they maybe wouldn’t have to ask the question. Thus, the person asking the question is little better off than they were before asking.</p> 
         <p>Now imagine this is a single word request:</p> 
         <blockquote> 
          <h1>Word for staring wide-eyed at a TV</h1> 
          <p>I saw my son staring wide-eyed at the television. His face looked so comical to me. Is there a word to describe such wide-eyed staring?</p> 
          <p>I’d like to use it like “My son was staring at the TV last night, it was so funny to see.”, but I don’t like <i>staring</i> because it doesn’t emphasise his wide-eyed-ness.</p> 
          <p>Is there a word that would better describe what I mean?</p>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>And then there is the answer:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          I think you’re looking for 
          <i>goggling</i>.
         </blockquote> 
         <p>Now you and I know that is a good word for the situation, but is it a <strong>helpful answer</strong>?</p> 
         <p>If you’re wondering, then let me tell you: it’s not. The Stack Exchange system itself will parse it and flag it as “low quality” and it will garner a comment from a moderator or other concerned member and then, if no improvements are made after a week or so, it will be deleted.</p> 
         <p>Yes, the asker now has a word to fill their gap, but the answer does not explain why <i>goggling</i> is fit for the purpose. The asker has no context to decide if this answer is the best fit, and no way to generalize the word to fit other situations.</p> 
         <p>Why is that important? The thing to remember is that the person who came here looking for an answer is unlikely to already know the answer. You don’t get many people who go around wondering “how many people know the word <i>goggling</i>?” (And I suspect most of those who do are crossword designers.)</p> 
         <p>If someone doesn’t already know the answer, then the details are important. When you suggest a word for a given context, you need to explain why it fits the context so that when they try and use it in the future they have a grasp on how the word works and what its connotations are.</p> 
         <p>I know many of you might complain that they should look it up in a dictionary. We’re a site for serious English language enthusiasts, after all.</p> 
         <p>That is irrelevant. An answer needs to be complete.</p> 
         <p>However, to entertain that idea for a moment. Most of our users are not serious enthusiasts. Most people come here looking for an answer and leave with one, without ever posting anything. That is the beauty of Stack Exchange.</p> 
         <p>That is why it is so important to leave a complete answer. With only half an answer, people will only half understand how to use a word.</p> 
         <p>So what does a better answer look like?</p> 
         <blockquote>
          I think you’re looking for 
          <i>goggling</i>. It’s from the verb *to goggle*, which means to stare at something with your eyes wide open and an amazed look on your face.
         </blockquote> 
         <p>Instantly this answer is a lot more helpful. By adding a definition the answer now gives a clear explanation why the word is suitable. Also note that the definition isn’t from a reference. When giving the explanation a reference can be useful, but if you have your own way to articulate the meaning, then that is fine, too.</p> 
         <p>If you do use a reference it is essential to cite your source. If you copy and paste without citing your source the answer will be deleted as plagiarism. With a reference the answer would be:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          I think you’re looking for 
          <i>goggling</i>. From 
          <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/goggle" target="_blank">ODO</a>, 
          <i>to goggle</i> means: 
          <blockquote>
           Look with wide open eyes, typically in amazement
          </blockquote> 
         </blockquote> 
         <p>The important points to remember:</p> 
         <ul> 
          <li>You are writing an answer for someone who doesn’t know anything about the word you’re suggesting.</li> 
          <li>An answer needs to explain the word in order for it to be useful.</li> 
          <li>If you are copy/pasting a definition you <strong>must</strong> cite where you got it from.</li> 
         </ul>

       <div class="excerpt_main"> 
        <div class="post-text"> 
         <p>People learning English are often confused by the many ways in which it is possible to talk about future events. They are not helped by the fact that some writers (eg, Sinclair<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>) claim that the construction with <em>will</em> in front of the base form (bare infinitive) of the verb is the <strong>future tense</strong>, while others (eg, Quirk et al<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>) claim that there is <strong>no future tense</strong> in English. Learners who have read in one book (eg, Thomson and Martinet<sup><a href="#ref4">3</a></sup>) that the <em>BE + going to</em> form expresses the subject’s <strong>intention to perform a future action</strong> will wonder what intention is present in <em>It’s going to rain</em>. Some course books appear to claim that there is only one way of expressing the future in any given situation, but learners will meet many native speakers who claim that several ways are often possible, and that there is no difference between them. In this blog post, I hope to clear up some of the confusion. Let’s begin by making two clear points: 1. There is little point in considering that English has a future tense. It is more realistic (and helpful) to think that there are several ways in English of expressing <strong>futurity</strong>. 2. Although each of the ways expresses a different way of looking at future situations, the speaker often has completely free choice at the moment of utterance, and there can be some overlap of meaning. There is often no single—or even ‘most appropriate’—form for a given situation. Now let’s look at the five most common ways of talking about future situations. We’ll do this by considering what forms are possible for the example <em>“Lindsay (fly) to New York next month”</em>.</p> 
         <h3>1. The present simple (non-past, unmarked) tense&nbsp; – <em>Lindsay <strong>flies</strong>…</em></h3> 
         <p>In English, as in many other languages, the so-called ‘present’ tense functions more like a default tense; it is used when there is no need for any additional temporal or aspectual information carried by other forms. The time of the situation denoted by the present simple tense of the verb can be past, present, future, or even unspecified. Let’s look at Lindsay’s future flight. If we imagine the speaker mentally seeing Lindsay’s schedule, and presenting a neutral fact without any of the overtones suggested by other ways of expressing the future (which we shall come to below), we can simply say:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>Lindsay <strong>flies</strong> to London next week.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>The futurity is shown&nbsp;by the context&nbsp;(for example,&nbsp;the previous mention of a schedule) or by explicit-markers (such as <em>next week</em> in the example above).</p> 
         <h3>2. The present progressive (continuous) – <em>Lindsay <strong>is flying</strong> …</em></h3> 
         <p>A better name for this aspect might be <strong>durative</strong>, as it is used when the speaker wishes to indicate both that the situation spoken of has duration and that that duration is limited. The fact that the situation has a beginning and an end, and that these are not considered remote in time, is more important than precisely when these occur. Consider these three utterances:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>1. I am writing some notes about the English language.</em> 
          <em>2. The number 22 tram is running through Florence this week.</em> 
          <em>3. I am meeting my wife at the pub this evening.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>In [1], the limited duration of the writing is clearly understood from the context. In [2], the known context of the normal route of the 22 tram (which does not usually&nbsp;include Florence) confirms the limited duration of the situation. It is perfectly correct for this to be said at 3 a.m., when no number 22 tram is actually running. I, the speaker, can say [3] because I know that my wife and I arranged the meeting this morning. The arrangement to meet has limited duration – it began this morning and ends when we actually meet. Considered this way, it is useful to think that one of the ways of using the progressive form&nbsp;is to&nbsp;indicate an arrangement. If an arrangement of limited duration is what the speaker has in mind, then the example sentence is now realised as:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>Lindsay <strong>is flying</strong> to London next week.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>As with the present simple, the futurity is shown by the context or by explicit time-markers.</p> 
         <h3>3. BE + going to – <em>Lindsay is going to fly</em>…</h3> 
         <p>Forms with <em>BE + going to</em> possibly originated in such utterances as:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>4. We are going to meet Andrea at the cinema.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>These types of phrases are spoken when we were literally <em>going</em>, as in ‘on our way to meet Andrea’. At the moment of speaking there was present evidence of the future meeting. This use has become extended to embrace any action for which there is present evidence – things do not have to be literally moving. Consider now these two utterances:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>5. Look at those black clouds. It’s going to rain.</em> 
          <em>6. Luke is going to see Bob Dylan in concert next year</em>.
         </blockquote> 
         <p>In [5] the present evidence is clear – the black clouds. In [6], the present evidence may be the tickets for the concert that the speaker has seen on Luke’s desk, or it may simply be the knowledge in the speaker’s mind that s/he has somehow acquired. This explains why, when the grammatical subject of the verb is capable of planning, there may be little practical difference between the use of the progressive form and the <em>BE + going to</em> form. However, with a grammatical subject incapable of planning, there is a difference:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>3. I am meeting my wife at the pub this evening.</em> 
          <em>3a. I am going to meet my wife at the pub this evening.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>Compared with:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>5. It’s going to rain.</em> 
          <em>5a. It’s raining.</em> 
          <em>5b. *<del>It’s raining tomorrow</del>.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>In [3], the speaker has made the arrangement with their wife. In [3a], the present evidence can be any or all of the speaker having made the arrangement, having been informed by their wife of the arrangement, or having recently made a plan. The circumstances surrounding the situations in [3] and [3a] differ, but the practical result is the same: the speaker has free choice between the two forms. Neither is ‘better’, ‘more appropriate’, or ‘more correct’. In [5], the present evidence is something like the presence of black clouds, or the speaker’s knowledge of the weather forecast. In [5a], it is impossible for an arrangement to be made for future rain, and therefore the progressive form used here cannot be referring to future arrangement. The context will therefore inform us that rain is actually falling as the utterance is made. The addition of a time-indicator cannot make the impossible possible, therefore [5b] is not a grammatical utterance. If the speaker has present evidence of next week’s flight, then the example will be realized as</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>Lindsay <strong>is going to fly</strong> to London next week.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <h3>4. Modal <em>will</em> – <em>Lindsay will fly</em> …</h3> 
         <p><em>Will</em> is a modal and, like the other modals, has two core ideas. The two core ideas for most modals are: (a) the ‘extrinsic’ meaning, referring to the <em>degree of certainty</em> of the event/state, and (b) the ‘intrinsic’ meaning, reflecting such concepts as: <em>ability, necessity,</em> <em> obligation, necessity, permission, possibility, volition,</em> etc. The extrinsic meaning of&nbsp;<em> will</em>&nbsp;is exemplified in:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>7. Emma left three hours ago, so she will be in Manchester by now.</em> 
          <em>8. There will be hotels on the moon within the next 50 years.</em> 
          <em>9. The afternoon will be bright and sunny, though there may be rain in the north.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>In all three examples, the speaker suggests 100% probability, i.e. absolute certainty; (<em>may</em> would imply possibility, <em>must</em> logical certainty, to take examples of two other modals). Note that while certainty in [8] and [9] is about the future, in [7] it is about the present. It is the absolute certainty, in the minds of speaker/writer and listener/reader, that can give the impression that forms using ‘the <em>will</em> future’ are some way of presenting ‘the future as fact’. Some writers therefore call this form ‘the Future Simple’. Weather forecasters, writers of business/scientific reports, deliverers of presentations, etc., frequently use <em>will</em>, and learners who encounter English more through reading native writers than hearing native speakers informally may assume that it is a ‘neutral’ or ‘formal’ future. In fact the particular native writer or speaker is simply opting to stress certainty rather than arrangement, plan or present evidence. The intrinsic meaning of <em>will</em> is exemplified in:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>10. I’ll carry your bag for you.</em>&nbsp;
          <em>&nbsp;</em> 
          <em>11. Will you drive me to the airport, please?</em> 
          <em>&nbsp;</em> 
          <em>12. Jed will leave his mobile switched on in meetings. It’s so annoying when it rings.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>These examples show what we might loosely call <em>volition,</em> the willingness or determination of the subject of the modal to carry out the action. Note that [12] is not about the future, and in [10] and [11] the futurity is incidental. It is context rather than words which gives the meaning. So, our original example can clearly be realized as:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>Lindsay will fly to London next week.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>Without expanded context or co-text, we cannot be sure of what is implied by Lindsay <em>will fly</em> . If the background has been that she is scheduled to fly next month, but there is an urgent need for her to be in London soon, the speaker of this utterance is indicating Lindsay’s willingness to fly earlier than intended. In a different context, known to both speaker and listener, the speaker is indicating the certainty of Lindsay’s flight tomorrow, possibly even because of the speaker’s own volition. Outside the context of gap-fill exercises this is not a problem. Note that some writers used to insist that for this way of expressing the future,<em> shall</em> could (Alexander<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>) or ought to (Wood<sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>) be used for first person forms. This ‘rule’ was never true except for a minority of speakers of BrE, and can safely be ignored by learners.</p> 
         <h3>5. Modal <em>will</em>+ progressive – <em>Lindsay</em> <strong><em>will be flying</em></strong></h3> 
         <p>… <em>will be … -ing</em> can have two possible overtones, both stemming from the combination of the ideas of certainty (<em>will</em>) and limited duration (progressive form). The first possibility is that the speaker is describing a situation already begun, having duration, and not completed by the time mentioned or implied.This would be explicit in:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>13. At 5 o’clock tomorrow Henry will be driving up the M6.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>The second possibility is that the speaker is more concerned with the pure certainty of the action happening than any volitional aspect that might be implied by the use of&nbsp;<em>will</em> by itself. This idea can be illustrated more clearly in the following examples. If someone says “I’d like to know what Joan thinks about this”, responses might be:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>14. I’ll see her tomorrow; I’ll ask her.</em> 
          <em>&nbsp;15. I’m seeing her tomorrow. I’ll ask her.</em> 
          <em>16. I’m going to see her tomorrow. I’ll ask her.</em> 
          <em>&nbsp;17. I’ll be seeing her tomorrow. I’ll ask her.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>In all four examples, the <em>I’ll ask her</em> indicates the speaker’s willingness (confirmed by context). In the first half of the utterance, [14] indicates the speaker’s willingness to see her, [15] the speaker’s knowledge of an arrangement already made to see her, [16] the speaker’s awareness of present evidence of the future meeting and [17] the speaker’s simple presentation of the fact of the future meeting. It is claimed by some writers, with some justification, that the use of <em>will be …-ing implies,</em> by its lack of reference to intention, volition or arrangement, a ‘casual’ future, the ‘future as a matter of course’ (Leech<sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>).. So, the realization of our standard example can be:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>Lindsay <strong>will be flying</strong> to London tomorrow.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <h3>Other ways of talking about the future</h3> 
         <p>We have looked at five common ways of expressing the future. We will now look very briefly at other ways. So far we have considered the five ways of referring to the future that are considered by some to be ‘tense’ forms: Present Progressive, Present Simple,&nbsp; <em>BE going to</em>,&nbsp; <em>will</em>, and <em>will be + …-ing.</em> There are many other ways of referring to future situations, each with its own particular shade of meaning. Some of these are considered briefly below.</p> 
         <h4><em>BE + to</em></h4> 
         <p>This form is not common in informal conversation. It refers to something that is to happen in the future as a plan or decree:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>Lindsay <strong>is to fly</strong> to London next week.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>It is common in news reports. In headlines <em>BE</em> is frequently omitted:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>18. Obama to meet Putin.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <h4><em>BE + about to</em></h4> 
         <p>This form is used to refer to planned future events that are expected to happen soon:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>19. 2,300 workers at the Manchester factory are about to lose their jobs.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>The soon-ness often carries the idea that the subject is very close to the point of doing something:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>Lindsay <strong>is about to leave</strong> for the airport.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <h4>Other idioms with <em>BE</em></h4> 
         <p>There are a number of other expressions with BE which have some form of modal-type meaning (<em>ability, obligation,</em> etc), and which point to the future. These include: <em>be able to, be bound to, be certain to, be due to, be likely to/that, be meant to, be obliged to, be supposed to, be sure to.</em></p> 
         <h4>Idioms with <em>HAVE</em></h4> 
         <p>Expressions with <em>HAVE</em>, such as <em>have (got) to</em> and <em>had better</em>, have some form of modal-type meaning (<em>necessity, obligation</em>, etc) pointing to the future.</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>Lindsay had better fly to London next week.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <h4>Other modals</h4> 
         <p>Apart from <em>will</em>, discussed earlier, other modals can also used with future reference:</p> 
         <blockquote> 
          <ul> 
           <li> <em>Lindsay <strong>can fly</strong> to London next week.</em> (possibility/ability/permission) </li> 
           <li> <em>Lindsay <strong>could fly</strong> to London next week</em>. (more remote possibility/ability) </li> 
           <li> <em>Lindsay <strong>may fly</strong> to London next week</em>. (possibility/permission) </li> 
           <li> <em>Lindsay <strong>might fly</strong> to London next week.</em> (more remote possibility/ permission) </li> 
           <li> <em>Lindsay <strong>must fly</strong> to London next week.</em> (obligation) </li> 
           <li> <em>Lindsay <strong>should fly</strong> to London next week.</em> (possibility/suggestion) </li> 
          </ul> 
         </blockquote> 
         <p>Expressions with <em>would,</em> with some form of quasi-modal meaning (preference) pointing to the future, include: <em>would rather, would sooner, would just as soon.</em> <strong>Verb + <em>to-</em> infinitive</strong> Some full verbs, such as <em>hope</em> or <em>want</em>, indicate that the action of the complement verb will be in the future (expressing future possibilities). Such verbs are usually followed by the to-infinitive:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>Lindsay <strong>hopes to fly</strong> to London next week.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>Examples include: <em>agree, ask<em>, allow</em>, aspire, attempt, cause<em>, choose, consent, dare</em>, decide, decline, encourage* expect<em>, hope, instruct</em>, intend<em>, offer, mean</em>, need<em>, permit</em>, persuade<em>, plan, prepare, promise, propose, swear, remember, tell</em>, threaten, try, want<em>, warn</em>, wish*</em> Some verbs (e.g. those marked with an asterisk above) can be followed by object + infinitive:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>John expects Lindsay<strong> to fly</strong> to London next week.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>A small number of verbs are followed by an object + bare infinitive, e.g. <em>have, help, let, make:</em> <em>Have Mr Smiley come in,&nbsp; please.</em></p> 
         <h4>Verb + gerund</h4> 
         <p>When a gerund follows a verb, or verb + object, the meaning is normally that the situations described are already in existence, i.e. they are not future situations:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>Lindsay hated flying.</em>
         </blockquote> 
         <p>However, a small number of verbs followed by a gerund complement point to the future. These include consider, <em>contemplate, fancy, feel like, put off, suggest.</em></p> 
         <blockquote>
          <em>Lindsay <strong>is considering flying</strong> to London next week.</em>
         </blockquote>

         <p>A question on EL&amp;U “<a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/224005/on-the-origin-of-blizzard/224893#224893">On the origin of ‘blizzard’</a>” asked about the origin of the word <i>blizzard</i>. The history of usage of the word during the period between when it first appears in print in the United Sates (1834) and when it is first used in the sense of “a fierce snowstorm” is fascinating (to me)—but even a less than exhaustive account of that history of usage too long to serve as an appropriate EL&amp;U answer. Consequently, I’m putting it here.</p> 
         <h2>PART I. Dictionary and Scholarly Analyses of ‘Blizzard’</h2> 
         <p>One weakness in some modern analyses of <i>blizzard</i> involves a failure to acknowledge the wide (and widening) extent of usage of the word prior to 1870, acting instead as though <i>blizzard</i> as Davy Crockett understood the word in 1834 and <i>blizzard</i> as used by Iowa farmers in 1870 had nothing in common but a coincidental spelling. A look at the actual history of U.S. usage of the word strongly suggests to me that the 1830s usages (of which there were more than one) almost certainly are ancestral to the 1870 usage. Unfortunately, attempting to substantiate this hypothesis entails reviewing a considerable number of examples from the period 1835 to 1870. Let’s start by looking at some early U.S. assessments of the word <i>blizzard</i>.</p> 
         <hr> 
         <p><b><i>Nineteenth-century U.S. analyses</i></b></p> 
         <p>The entry for <i>blizzard</i> in J.S. Farmer &amp; W.E. Henley, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=CbATAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=%22blizzard+subs+popular%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Qb7JVKelKZbdoATxloLoDQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22blizzard%20subs%20popular%22&amp;f=false"><i>Slang and Its Analogues</i></a> (1890) is interesting, in part, because it reports on the word as a recently popularized term:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <b>blizzard</b> 
          <i>subs.</i> (popular). — A poser [defined elsewhere in the dictionary as “an unanswerable question or argument”] ; a stunning blow ; an unanswerable argument, etc., etc.This word, brought into prominent notice as the name by which sudden and exceptionally severe snow storms are known in the Western States of America, is one the etymology of which is dubious. Some authorities derive it from the German 
          <i>blitz</i>—lightning, but a correspondent of 
          <i>N[otes] &amp; Q[ueries]</i> claims it as of English nationality, asserting that the word has been known in the Midland Counties in its present form, or nearly so, for over thirty years ; further stating that ‘may I be blizzered’ is a common oath there. Assuming that the expression is a variation of the more generally familiar ‘May God strike me blind’ (that is, presumably by lightning), there is nothing antagonistic between the two theories of its genesis, and a further light is perhaps thrown upon the subject, tending to support its German origin, by the fact that, in Pennsylvania, it has been familiar, according to a correspondent of the 
          <i>New York Sun</i>, for more than half a century, its use and meaning being akin to the instances above mentioned. It appears that in the central counties of the State in question, the word was always used to include the idea of the ‘poser,’ and even of force, violence, spitefulness, or vindictiveness. If one dealt another a hostile blow, he ‘gave him a BLIZZARD on the nose,’ ‘on the jaw,’ ‘between the eyes,’ etc. If a magistrate lectured a litigant severely he ‘gave him a BLIZZARD.’ If in debate one dealt mercilessly in ridicule he ‘gave his opponent a BLIZZARD.’ If one man swore at or cursed another he ‘gave him a BLIZZARD.’ If a man’s wife scolded him she ‘gave him a BLIZZARD.’ When it is remembered that Pennsylvania is the State in which the Dutch or German element most largely predominates, it does not seem far fetched to attribute its origin to a Teutonic source, more especially as there is nothing in the English usage to preclude such a derivation. However this may be, the word invariably seems to imply suddenness combined with violence ; and, at any rate, it apparently disposes of the supposition that the word is of Western origin, or a coinage of so recent a date as is frequently supposed. Like most words of its class, which have largely struck the popular taste, it has been generally adopted in an idiomatic sense to signify a stunning blow ; an overwhelming argument, or a cool reception. [First example:] 1834 [David] Crockett, 
          <i>Tour Down East</i>, 16. A gentleman at dinner asked me for a toast ; and supposing that he meant to have some fun at my expense, I concluded to go ahead and give him and his likes a BLIZZARD.

         <p>A fuller version of the Davy Crockett quotation appears in Crockett, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=4b4TAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22his+likes+a+blizzard%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RrrJVIv1JZDWoATr7YFA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22his%20likes%20a%20blizzard%22&amp;f=false"><i>An Account of Col. Crockett’s Tour to the North and Down East, in the Year of Our Lord One Thousand Eight Hundred and Thirty-four</i></a>, tenth edition (1837):</p> 
         <blockquote>
          When dinner was ready [on a steamboat running from Delaware City to Philadelphia], I sat down with the rest of the passengers ; among them was the Reverend O. B. Brown, of the Post Office Department, who sat near me. During dinner the parson called for a bottle of wine, and called on me for a toast. Not knowing whether he intended to compliment me, or abash me among so many strangers, or have some fun at my expense, I concluded to go ahead and give him and his likes a 
          <b>blizzard</b>. So our glasses being filled, the word went round, “a toast from Colonel Crockett.” I gave it as follows: “Here’s wishing the bones of tyrant kings may answer in hell, in place of gridirons, to roast the souls of Tories on.” At this the parson appeared as if he was stump’t. I said, “Never heed ; it was meant for where it belonged.” He did not repeat his invitation, and I eat my dinner quietly.

          <i> (American), a word of many meanings. In one of the early Crockett almanacs about 1836 it appears as distinctly meaning a shot from a rifle. </i>

          <i> It has been conjectured that in this sense it was derived from blaze, or from the (Canadian) French </i>blesser

His friends took it up and have since called a storm of wind accompanied by now a blizzard. Some years ago the origin of the word was sought and it was said to be Indian, and that an Indian used the expression (or one similar in sound) upon seeing some white men coming out off a severe snowstorm.—</i>Detroit Free Press

         <p><i>The reference to </i>Notes and Queries<i> in </i>Slang &amp; Its Analogues<i> appears to be to two comments in the periodical. First, from the February 11, 1888 edition, this item from W. E. Buckley:</i></p>
         <i> </i>
         <blockquote>
          <i>BLIZZARD.—The American correspondence of the Times, Jan. 16 to 19, of this year, has contained details of a terrific blizzard, which had been raging in several of the N. and N.W. states. In the ‘New Engl. Dict.,’ Dr. Murray says that it is a modern word, and in the sense of a “snow-squall” became general in the severe winter of 1880–81, although it had been so applied about 1860 to 1870. It seems to have been adopted by English journalists since 1880, from the Americans. The earliest example quoted is in 1834, from Col. Crockett’s ‘Tour down East,’ in the sense of a “poser,” as if a blast they could not stand. The snowstorm of Jan. 18, 1881, in this country was no feeble instance of a blizzard, as it blew up and about the </i>poudre

One who has had to face a severe storm of snow, hail, rain, dust, or wind, would say on reaching shelter that he has “faced a blizzer,” or that the storm was “a regular blizzard.” A blinding flash of lightning would call forth the exclamation, “My! that wor a blizzomer!” or “That </i>wor

         <p><i>In this regard, it is regrettable that the English Dialect Society, which produced such fine work in other counties of England during the nineteenth century, seems not to have published a full-scale glossary of Nottinghamshire words. In his </i>English Dialect Dictionary<i> (1898), Joseph Wright lists <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=oEMOAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=%22English+Dialect+Society%22+Nottinghamshire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SaTNVICRHYbioASAgIGADA&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22English%20Dialect%20Society%22%20Nottinghamshire&amp;f=false">three undated ms collections</a> of Nottinghamshire words, by three different authors, but I don’t know whether any of these ever saw publication. Part of the problem may have been that such a glossary (by a fourth compiler) was widely anticipated to be well on the way toward completion. In January 1875, in a section of the </i>Second Report for the Year 1874<i> titled “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5so9AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=%22English+Dialect+Society%22+Nottinghamshire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SaTNVICRHYbioASAgIGADA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22English%20Dialect%20Society%22%20Nottinghamshire&amp;f=false">Work in Course of Preparation</a>,” the society had written this:</i></p>

         <p><i>Worksop is also the town from which Ratcliffe sent his communication to </i>Notes and Queries<i> in 1888. But as far as I can tell, the White manuscript was never published.

          <blockquote>

         <p><i>Joseph Wright’s English Dialect Dictionary follows Ratcliffe in listing </i>blizzarded<i> (“Used imprecatively”), </i>blizzer<i> (“A blaze, flash ; a blinding flash of lightning”), and </i>blizzom<i> (“A blaze, a flash”) as being “in gen. use in the midl. counties”—but the only source he supplies for each of these terms is Ratcliffe’s comment in </i>Notes &amp; Queries<i>.

         <p><i>In its very lengthy treatment of </i>blizzard<i>, </i>Webster’s Word Histories<i> (1989) gives considerable play to the word’s connection to a major snowstorm in Iowa in 1870:</i></p>
         <i> </i>
         <blockquote>
          <i><p><b>blizzard</b> There is a tradition of sorts in Iowa that the word blizzard<i> for severe snowstorm with high winds originated there. Allen Walker Read went to Iowa in 1926 to look into the tradition, and his findings, published in 1928, show that there is considerable evidence in its favor. The earliest printed citation for the use that is so far known appeared in the Estherville, Iowa, </i>Northern Vindicator<i> on 23 April 1870. It was spelled </i>blizards<i>, and was cautiously enclosed in quotation marks. One week later, in the 30 April edition, it appears again, with the now familiar double -z spelling, but still in quotation marks. In June of 1870 the local baseball team adopted the name </i>Blizzards<i>—it must have been a memorably hard winter.</i></p><i> <p>…</p> </i><p><i>The relatively rapid spread of an unusual word has naturally excited some speculation about its origin, and a number of explanations have been offered for it. Since many of these appeared a long time after </i>blizzard<i> became common, it is impossible to verify them. Some claim credit for one locality or another, giving the speculations an air of home-town rivalry. The </i>Dictionary of Americanisms<i> has citations dated 1859 and 1861 from a diary published in the </i>Kansas Historical Quarterly<i> in 1932. The diary was kept by an army captain at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. It turns out, however, that the diarist revised or enlarged or rewrote the diary about 1905, when </i>blizzard<i> was a common word, and we do not know whether he unconsciously used it in his revision, or if he had used it in the original, which was unfortunately thrown away. No printed evidence, however, has yet been found that antedates the </i>Northern Vindicator<i>.</i></p><i> </i><p><i>The (possibly adulterated) <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=fDAUAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22chilled+could+not+get+up%22&amp;dq=%22chilled+could+not+get+up%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vZ_MVPKiHpWyoQTIiYB4&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ" target="_blank">1859 diary example</a> from the 1932 </i>Kansas Historical Quarterly<i> reads as follows:</i></p><i> <p>Sure it would freeze the horn of a brass monkey, remarked Kelly, (an old veteran), and I thought it might do it, for a <b>blizzard</b> had come upon us about midnight and I thought it a howling success. No breakfast, formed line, shot 7 horses that were so chilled could not get up, started out by twos from the right, trot march for Cottonwood creek.

          <i> (a violent snowstorm) may be an extension of the earlier sense (a volley of shots) or may have originated in England. A blizzard of etymologies have been offered for this puzzling word.

          <i> (lightning). Another version suggests French </i>blesser
          <i> (to wound), but neither this nor the German can be substantiated. Yet another claims that </i>blizzard

          <i>, meaning “a blaze” or “flash” (“Put towthry sticks on th’ fire, an’ let’s have a blizzer,” </i>English Dialect Dictionary

          <i>, “a violent and injurious blow,” which itself derived from the French </i>blesser
          <i>, “to injure or wound.” “Blizzard,” in the sense of a violent blow, seems to have been an early 19th-century Kentuckyism promoted to national usage through Davy Crockett’s highly romanticized autobiography of 1834, in which he used the term for a well-aimed musket shot. By the 1840s it was widely understood to mean a cannon shot, and during the American Civil War (1861–65) both sides were using “blizzard” to mean a withering volley of musket or cannon fire. As for meteorological applications, “blizzard” was used in the 1850s for a sudden and violent drop in temperature. It was first used to describe a snowstorm in 1870 when O.C. Bates, neologistic editor of The Northern Vindicator of Estherville, Iowa, used it for the terrific snowstorms that socked in the state that spring. He claimed he had picked up the term from a local character called Lightning Ellis but, either way, he made such frequent use of it that everyone, other newspapers included, started talking of “The Great Blizzard,” which forever changed the accepted meaning of the word. </i>

           In the early 19th century a blizzard was ‘a sharp blow or knock’ or ‘a shot’ in the USA, and probably arose as an imitation of the sound of a blow. The sense of ‘a severe snowstorm’ followed in the 1850s.

         <blockquote>
           A riot occurred at Morrow [Ohio] on Saturday evening, which will probably give some trouble to the parties engaged in it. A theft was committed by a colored man named Henry Watkins—a convict formerly in the Penitentiary—who was immediately arrested and committed to jail. This aroused the indignation of sundry persons in the village, who met on Friday and resolved that every negro should leave the place in one week thereafter. Notice was accordingly given, and on Saturday, as we understand, all had left with the exception of two, Charles Casey and his wife, who had been assured that they would be suffered to remain. The ardor of the mob—for so we must characterize every body of men who set the laws of the country at defiance and meditate and commit violence on the persons and property of others—was quickened by their wrath, and on Saturday night they changed the time of the exodus of the Casey family an demanded that they should gird up their loins, put on their sandals and march forthwith. Casey refused to obey. At ten o’clock they approached the dwelling of the latter, and commenced an assault with stones and clubs.—Casey took a position at the door, armed with an axe, and his wife guarded the window, club in hand. Soon the window was smashed in and a breach made through the door by the missiles of the assailants. An entry was then attempted by one of the mob, but the moment his head protruded through the door, Casey tapped him with the back of the axe, and he fell senseless to the ground. Instantly another mob-head was poked in and met a similar 
          <b>blizzard</b>. These repeated and effectual rebuffs brought the mob to a parley.

          We stop the Press to announce that we have been creditably informed, that the Whigs have succeeded in bringing out Jackson, of Giles, for Floater [“A candidate representing several counties and therefore not considered directly responsible to any one of them”—Slang and Its Analogues], as we predicted they would, in another column. This information, we trust, will be sufficient to arouse every Democrat within the district to come out and do his whole duty. Yes, fellow Democrats, come out and vote for the man who is most likely to beat the Whig Missionary of Giles; it is enough to know, without saying a word about the importance of next Legislature, that this man Jackson is not only Whig of the deepest dye, but is the man who undertook to blackguard the people of Lincoln [County, Tennessee] by contributing money to send a Missionary up here to enlighten us.

         <p><b><i>Summary of the cited examples</i></b></p> 
         <p>The cited uses of <i>blizzard</i> above break out into the following senses, with years of occurrence following):</p> 
         <ul> 
          <li><p>Blast with a firearm or cannon (whether one or multiple bullets or pellets uncertain): 1834, 1834, 1836, 1846, 1846, 1862</p></li> 
          <li><p>Verbal blast: 1835, 1848, 1851, 1860, 1861, 1863, 1865, 1868</p></li> 
          <li><p>Blast with a firearm or cannon (single ball or bullet): 1835, 1857, 1863</p></li> 
          <li><p>Blazing fire: 1843</p></li> 
          <li><p>Heavy or painful physical blow (not involving a firearm): 1849, 1856, 1860, 1861, 1866, 1870, 1870</p></li> 
          <li><p>Literal or figurative attack: 1851, 1866, 1867</p></li> 
          <li><p>Exclamation (like “the blazes” or “blue blazes”): 1853, 1857</p></li> 
          <li><p>Blast with multiple firearms or with a firearm loaded with multiple pellets): 1860, 1863, 1863</p></li> 
          <li><p>Shot of liquor: 1870</p></li> 
         </ul> 
         <p>Several things are noteworthy about these results. First, within thirteen years of the first confirmed use of <i>blizzard</i> in the sense of “snowstorm,” the word was being used in at least five other distinct senses (firearm blast, verbal blast, physical blow, exclamation, and shot of liquor). Second, the usage doesn’t seem as geographically narrow as we might have expected from the contemporaneous identification of blizzard as a “Western” word: Stories using the word appeared in newspapers located in California, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia. Third, in the 1860s use of the term in its various meanings seems to have been on the increase. Fourth, we see the emergence around 1860 of the use of blizzard in the sense of a volley or fusillade or flurry of pellets or bullets. The conceptual distance between such a flurry of missiles and a snowstorm is far less than the distance between a single bullet and a snowstorm.</p> 
         <p>In view of these considerations, I think it is highly likely that <i>blizzard</i> in the sense of snowstorm emerged not independently of the other meanings or directly from a Midlands English dialectal usage, but from one of the several U.S. slang meanings of the word that were then current. As for whether those words arose out of Anglo-Saxon <i>blysa</i>, French <i>blesser</i>, German <i>Blitz</i>, or onomatopoeic <i>blizzzz-urd</i> remains a matter for speculation.</p>

        <div class="post-text"> 
         <p>Hello my friend! How are you doing? It is good to see you around these parts, the Stack Exchange network is a lovely part of the Internet where we can all help each other to learn.</p> 
         <p>Of course, though, there are rules by which we should abide if we want to keep this place friendly and free of noise. Hey, now, do not look like that. It is true there are many rules, but they are normally quite useful.</p> 
         <p>Today I want to tell you about how to communicate with your fellow Stack Exchange users. For example: you have seen something someone has written and you disagree. You are a polite person, so you do not think you should just downvote and leave. I admire your style. Communication is good. At Stack Exchange we are allowed to make comments on people’s posts to ask for clarification and to point out mistakes. Obviously we do this in as friendly a way as possible.</p> 
         <p>Oh? You cannot comment? I see, I see. Do not be troubled. Comments are a <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/privileges/comment">privilege</a>, which is earned by attaining 50 reputation points on this site. It is a mere trifle. You will find that by contributing good quality answers and questions you will be there in a few days, maybe even less.</p> 
         <p>It is important to note that comments are not permanent parts of the site and they get deleted when they outlive their usefulness. Ideally the useful information in a comment will be integrated into the post the comment is on, thus making the comment redundant.</p> 
         <p>Also, you should understand that the main site is not for discussion. Comments should not be used to discuss a topic at length.</p> 
         <p>Yes, you are quite right. Sometimes discussion is useful, or necessary. For that there is another place! It is a wonderful place, really. There is much adventure to be had. We call this place <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/95/english-language-usage">chat</a>. The ability to chat is also a <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/privileges/chat">privilege</a>, but it has a lower bar. Only 20 reputation points are required.</p> 
         <p>Chat is used for discussion, yes, but the discussion can roam from being purely about topics on the main site. Many times people wander in with simple questions, questions that might not be suitable for the main site, and ask them in the chat room. This is fine, encouraged even. There is of course a lot of other discussion going on there too, it can get quite frenetic, but do not be afraid to jump in. Be courteous and not pushy and you will be fine.</p> 
         <p>One excellent trick you can do with chat is to take a discussion in comments and move it to a chat room. This is useful if you think the discussion will become long. Also, if you would like to chat with someone, but they and you are finding the main room too difficult, you can create your own room. The new room will be public, but people generally do not stray from the main room unless they are invited.</p> 
         <p>Well, my friend, I hope you stay a while. There is a lot you can learn, and maybe a lot you can teach! We will be glad to hear from you.</p>

        <div class="post-text"> 
         <p>‘One Language, Many Voices’ was the title of <a href="http://www.bl.uk/learning/news/evolvingenglish.html">an exhibition at the British Library in 2010-11</a>. It sums up what English is and always has been. This simple truth is overlooked by those who take a one-size-fits-all approach to language. An historical perspective may help to set the record straight.</p> 
         <p>English has its origins in the various north-west European dialects which were spoken by the tribes who invaded England from the middle of the fifth century, and which displaced the native Celtic, which remains only in a few words like <em>brock</em> (badger), <em>cwm</em> (valley) and some place names. The surviving literature from the period allows us to identify an Anglo-Saxon language, now usually known as Old English. However, the texts we have still show dialectical differences, and it seems likely that the spoken dialects of Old English were sometimes mutually incomprehensible.</p> 
         <p>For a period, the Wessex dialect was the most prestigious, showing that then, as now, any one variety of the language predominates not for linguistic reasons, but for political, economic and social reasons. However, the language was by no means static during this period, because the rule of the Wessex king, Alfred the Great, coincided with the Viking invasions, which brought new words and new grammar into English which remain with us today.</p> 
         <p>The next most significant influence on the language was the Norman invasion of 1066. So pervasive was Norman French that it eclipsed English for many years in the administration of the country, but although Norman French was the official language, we may suppose that English, in all its varieties, continued to be spoken by the majority. English later resurfaced in public discourse, and in 1362 the Statute of Pleading allowed it to be used in Parliament. Soon after this time, Chaucer was writing the first great works of English literature in a form of the language that is much more recognizably English than its Old English predecessor. Chaucer wrote in his own dialect, which happened to be that of the east Midlands, spoken in the triangle formed by Oxford, Cambridge and London. The language spoken and written at this time is known as Middle English, but great literature survives in dialects other than Chaucer’s, including William Langland’s ‘Vision of Piers Plowman’.</p> 
         <p>Chaucer had a stroke of luck when William Caxton, the first English printer, came to print Chaucer’s works. Because of the proliferation of dialects, Caxton was unsure which to use in his printed books, so he just chose the one he was most familiar with, his own. This happened to be Chaucer’s as well, so the combination of a great writer and the first printer determined the course of English ever after. This particular dialect, which was to become the basis of what we now know as Standard English, was not chosen because it had some particular linguistic merit that other dialects lacked. Any other dialect would have served just as well.</p> 
         <p>Middle English turned into Early Modern English, the language of Shakespeare, but there is evidence from his plays that other dialects existed alongside what was becoming the standard one. The conscious process of standardisation didn’t begin until the eighteenth century, when speakers of English, most of whom until then had probably never given the matter a second thought, started to become self-conscious about their use of language and sought guidance. As today, there was no shortage of self-styled experts willing to help them out. They made up rules about English, which reflected their own personal preferences, and were based on Latin, a language which has a quite different grammar from that of English and other Germanic languages. Their idiosyncratic prescriptions remain with us. To some they are as holy writ and are stoutly defended by people who know little of their origins. In truth, they are shibboleths, whose main purpose is to allow those with a little education to show their assumed superiority over those who have been unfortunate enough to have had less.</p> 
         <p>Since the eighteenth century, English has changed, and become more widely spoken, in ways that earlier speakers could not have imagined. It has absorbed vocabulary from around the world and, thanks first to the British Empire and, since the start of the twentieth century, to the global influence of the United States, has become the first international language since Latin. The history of English is complex and long, but this very brief summary is necessary for countering the prejudices that all too often typify discussion of the language today. It is the failure to appreciate that English exists in many varieties, as it has always done, that is behind much misunderstanding. Within the United Kingdom alone, some regional dialects can be almost incomprehensible to those from other regions, and so can some social dialects to those from different social classes. More widely, there are varieties of English spoken in Singapore, New Zealand, Nigeria, India, Canada and the United States, to name just a few places where English is either a first or second language, and within these English-speaking communities there will be further sub-varieties.</p> 
         <p>All varieties, standard and non-standard alike, have an internally consistent system of grammar, and speakers of non-standard varieties are not, by that fact alone, inarticulate, unintelligent or ignorant. The difficulty in understanding those who speak differently from ourselves often lies in accent rather than grammar or vocabulary. <a href="http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/dick/SEtrudgill.htm">As Peter Trudgill has shown</a>, the grammar of nonstandard varieties does not differ so very greatly from Standard English. Where it does, it can be more complex. For example, as Trudgill says,</p> 
         <blockquote>
          ‘Standard English fails to distinguish between the forms of the auxiliary forms of the verb “do” and its main verb forms. This is true both of present tense forms, where many other dialects distinguish between auxiliary 
          <em>I do, he do</em> and main verb&nbsp;
          <em>I does</em>,
          <em> he does</em> or similar, and the past tense, where most other dialects distinguish between auxiliary&nbsp;
          <em>did</em> and main verb&nbsp;
          <em>done</em>, as in&nbsp;
          <em>You done it, did you?</em>’
         </blockquote> 
         <p>Nevertheless, some form of commonly understandable norm is essential, and Standard English fills the role. It is the variety of the language used in published work, and in education, journalism and broadcasting, the law and public administration, and by the small minority of people for whom it is a native spoken variety. Provided it is understood as a neutral term, not implying ‘high standard’, Standard English is preferable to alternatives such as BBC English, Oxford English or The Queen’s English, and is the one used by professional linguists. If not universally spoken and written, it is widely understood, and for that reason schools have a duty to teach it.</p> 
         <p>None of this should be seen as undervaluing the linguistic merits of nonstandard varieties. They contribute to the richness of the language which we have inherited from those diverse tribes who came to Britain so long ago. We should celebrate rather than condemn them.</p>

       <div class="excerpt_main"> 
        <div class="post-text"> 
         <p>English is constantly adding, modifying, and repurposing words.</p> 
         <p>Look, there’s one right now: <em>repurpose.</em> According to The American Heritage Dictionary, it is officially a word:</p> 
         <div style="background-color: #e3f3f3;padding: 4px 12px 16px;margin-bottom: 12px">
          <strong>re·pur·pose </strong>
          <em>tr.v.</em>&nbsp;
          <strong>re·pur·posed</strong>,&nbsp;
          <strong>re·pur·pos·ing</strong>,&nbsp;
          <strong>re·pur·pos·es </strong> 
          <div></div> To use or convert for use in another format or product:&nbsp;
          <em>repurposed the book as a compact disk.</em> 
         </div> 
         <p>Etymonline cites its usage from 1995, so it is relatively new. It is made by adding<em> re-</em> to the word <em>purpose</em>, which can be either a noun or a verb. My money is on noun, because the new construct comes out of business or technical jargon and <em>purpose</em> as a verb is pretty seldom heard. Not that it would be wrong. In fact, it would not be surprising if <em>purpose</em>&nbsp;used as a verb were revived as a back-formation of <em>repurpose</em>.</p> 
         <p>In this season of giving, let’s look at the words <em>give</em> and <em>gift</em>. <em>Give</em> is a verb and <em>gift</em> is a noun, right? True. But haven’t you ever found some mechanical thing to be loose when it was supposed to be tight and said, “I feel a little&nbsp;<em>give</em> in it”? Of course you have. Verb has been nouned. You nouned it yourself.</p> 
         <p>Similarly, we’ve all heard someone use the word <em>gift</em> as a verb: “She gifted them all with front-row seats to the concert.” And whether our inner fussbudget winces or not when we hear it said that way, it is still a legitimate usage. Face it: the traditional verb form <em>give</em> doesn’t say as much, and simply isn’t as precise. “She gave them all front-row seats to the concert.” That doesn’t exactly carry the connotation of presenting them with a gift, does it? She could have been paying them back for prior favors, or because she lost a bet — any number of non-giftish reasons come to mind.</p> 
         <p>Who can forget the “regifting” episode of the immensely popular TV show <em>Seinfeld</em>? (Hmm, that occurred right around the time <em>repurpose</em> came into the lexicon. Coincidence?) And if we admit that the writers and actors on that show were all very <em>gifted</em>, we’ve now adjectived a noun. We might even have adjectived the noun very <em>giftedly</em>, in which case we’ve adverbed the adjective. It goes on.</p> 
         <p>There really is nothing to be afraid of. Languages change, and words get overloaded, adapted, modified. Some people abhor this condition. Some feel language should be as precise as mathematics: see John Quijada’s artificially constructed language, <a title="Ithkuil language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithkuil">Ithkuil</a>, if you don’t believe me. Me, I prefer the richness of everyday speech, and the creative way people adapt words to mean new things. Isn’t it more colorful and descriptive to say a basketball player <em>bricked</em> a shot, rather than falling back on the boring and pedestrian&nbsp;<em>missed</em>? A horrible shot in basketball looks like someone throwing a brick, not a ball, and if we verb the noun we get a shot that has been <em>bricked</em>.</p> 
         <p>Language is a living thing. Let’s never forget that. If words stop changing, a language starts dying, just as our bodies do if our cells stop dying and being reborn.</p> 
         <p>While we’re on the subject, let’s look at <em>that </em>verb:&nbsp;<em>live</em>. The noun form is, of course, <em>life</em>. Since the 1830s, the noun&nbsp;<em>lifer</em> has referred to a prisoner serving a life sentence. But wait a sec, didn’t it have to become a verb first? Isn’t a verb at least implied there: <em>lifer</em>, one who <em>lifes</em>? No? Let’s move forward in time and notice a shift in meaning: <em>lifer</em> now includes someone who is serving “for life” in the military. I recently read the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Generation-Kill-Evan-Wright/dp/0425224740/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356198388&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=generation+kill"><em>Generation Kill</em></a>&nbsp;by Evan Wright, who was embedded with a platoon of Recon Marines that participated in the assault on Baghdad in 2003. After Saddam’s army was defeated, one of the Marines, Corporal Ray Person, is quoted as he grouses about the battalion first sergeant’s return to his meddlesome “lifer” ways. Person complains:</p> 
         <div style="background-color: #e3f3f3;padding: 4px 12px 16px;margin-bottom: 12px">
          “The second they stop shooting at us, [that] motherfucker’s lifin’ us in his stupid fucking retardese.”
         </div> 
         <p>Ahh, there it is. Crude though his statement may be, his verbing of a noun that arose from the prior verbing of the same noun is pure poetry. And exactly right for the sentiment the soldier wished to express. What is a lifer sergeant doing to Marines when he makes their lives miserable with a lot of petty regulations? He is&nbsp;<em>lifing</em> them. And he is doing so in the imaginary-yet-somehow-very-real language Cpl. Person vulgarly calls <em>retardese</em>, which consists, presumably, of one stupid, ungrammatical statement after another spoken in a near-incomprehensible hillbilly drawl.</p> 
         <p>I hope you can’t find any give in my arguments. But I wish to gift you with one final thought on the protean nature of English. Wallace Stevens said it about poetry, but it goes for language in general as well: </p>
         <pre style="font-family: 'Courier New',monospace">    It has to be living, to learn the speech of the place.
    It has to face the men of the time and to meet
    The women of the time. It has to think about war
    And it has to find what will suffice. It has
    To construct a new stage.</pre> In other words, it has to be a living, changing entity, continually adapting, being adapted, constructing a new stage. Fortunately for all of us, it is.

         <p>Your question has been “Closed as General Reference”. That raises more questions: What does that mean? Why was it closed? What should you do about it?</p> 
         <h2>What Does It Mean?</h2> 
         <p>First, what it <em>doesn’t</em>&nbsp;mean. It <em>doesn’t</em>&nbsp;mean “Your question is worthless. Don’t bother us.” It <em>certainly</em>&nbsp;doesn’t mean “You are an illiterate cretin. Go away” — although some people take it that way.</p> 
         <p><em>Closed</em>&nbsp;means “Closed for repairs”.&nbsp; And <em>General Reference</em>&nbsp;means “You could look it up.”</p> 
         <h2>Why Was it Closed?</h2> 
         <p>That’s&nbsp;very easy to answer: we believe that your question (as it stands) can be answered by consulting a standard online reference work.</p> 
         <p>It makes a lot more sense for <em>you</em> to do that than us. If <em>you</em> look it up you will find not only the answer to the question you asked but also the answers to many other questions you might have <em>intended</em> to ask that we don’t know about.</p> 
         <p>You will also get your answer faster, since you won’t have to wait for one (or more) of us to perform the lookup and incorporate the results in a Witty and Incisive Response. (Wit and Incisiveness are hard to achieve, and a good Response can take a long time to compose.)</p> 
         <p>And: you may also learn something about what online resources are available to you, and what they offer which might satisfy future needs.</p> 
         <h2>What Should You Do?</h2> 
         <p>Depends.&nbsp; Very often people will have posted an answer to your question, or will have posted what amounts to an answer in the comments. If all you’re interested in is the answer, you’ve got it: you’re done.</p> 
         <p>If you didn’t get a satisfactory answer this way, do what the Closed banner tells you:</p> 
         <h3>Look it up.</h3> 
         <p>Again, people will often post a link directing you to an appropriate online reference. If not, a lot of useful references are listed <a title="here" href="http://meta.english.stackexchange.com/questions/2573/list-of-general-references">here</a>&nbsp;and <a title="here" href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1482/what-are-your-favorite-english-language-tools">here</a>. These lists are particularly valuable for the comments which accompany them. The works fall mostly into four broad categories:</p> 
         <ul> 
          <li><strong>Dictionaries</strong> provide far more than just definitions: etymologies, examples, citations, and often brief notes on “standard” usage (debate rages over what exactly that means, but that’s instructive, too). <em>Don’t consult just one</em>: Dictionaries vary greatly not just in overall quality but in the value of individual entries.</li> 
          <li><strong>Thesauruses</strong> (or <em>thesauri</em>, or even more piquantly <em>thesauroi</em>) are useful for recalling words you can’t quite remember, but they don’t usually tell you much about which synonym you should use where. But they can be fun.</li> 
          <li><strong>Corpora</strong> provide many more examples of actual use of a word or phrase than dictionaries, and can be particularly valuable guides to when and how synonyms differ.</li> 
          <li><strong>Style guides</strong> are the best source for prescriptive rules of grammar, syntax, spelling, punctuation, and documentation. They all differ in many details, however; select the one that is recommended by your school or discipline or (if you are so fortunate as to have one) your publisher.</li> 
         </ul> 
         <p>A hint: &nbsp;<a title="OneLook" href="http://www.onelook.com">OneLook</a>&nbsp;is a very useful tool: input a word or phrase and it returns you links to many dictionaries and other references conveniently listed on one page.</p> 
         <p>But what if these references don’t provide you what you need? — no reference work can answer all questions. In that case, come back to ELU and</p> 
         <h3>Fix your question.</h3> 
         <p>Click <strong><em>edit</em></strong> immediately beneath your post and rewrite it.</p> 
         <ul> 
          <li>Tell us what you’ve found out, and focus our attention on what your research leaves unanswered.</li> 
          <li>If anybody left useful comments, address those.</li> 
          <li>Give us as much context as you can. What is it you’re trying to understand (or say)? Who said it (or to whom do you want to say it), where and when? What <em>register</em>&nbsp;are you concerned with? — formal, colloquial, vulgar?</li> 
          <li>Don’t forget to change your title Question to fit the new content.</li> 
         </ul> 
         <p>The more you can tell us, the better we can answer.</p> 
         <p>If you’ve got at least 20 rep, you can pop over to <strong><em>Chat</em></strong> (the link’s at the top of the ELU page) for help. There’s usually somebody around to hold your hand. And if you fix it all by yourself, come by Chat when you’re done and report it. It takes a moderator or five high-rep users to get your question reopened, so you want to draw their attention to the work you’ve done.</p> 
         <p>Trust me. That’s how you get a Witty and Incisive Response—or several. That’s how you get Upvotes and Reputation. That’s how you learn to use resources you never knew about. That’s how you Make Friends and Influence People.</p> 
         <p>You could look it up.</p>

       <div class="excerpt_main"> 
        <div class="post-text"> 
         <p>Speech and the written language differ in many ways. Speech developed before writing and we learn to speak before we learn to write. For a long time there was no written language at all, and there are languages that have no written form. That is not to say we can say what we like and hope to be understood. Speech has its rules. In English, we must say, ‘Shut the door’ rather than, ‘Shut door the’ or ‘Shut of door’, and we must say ‘streets’ rather than ‘street, street’ when we mean more than one. Anyone who applies such rules consistently speaks correct English. The only people who don’t are those who have yet to learn them: infants and those who are learning English as a foreign language.</p> 
         <p>There are many varieties of spoken English and there is no reason to suppose that one variety is linguistically superior to any other. At the same time, we do well to use a spoken language that is tolerably close to that of the people with whom we expect to spend most of our lives. For the middle-class, that means adopting the dialect known as Standard English. It can be spoken in any accent, but is often associated with the accent of educated people living in London and the south-east of England. But it’s no more and no less correct than Midlands, Liverpool, Tyneside, Indian, Australian or Caribbean English.</p> 
         <p>Written language derives from speech, but we have to make a deliberate attempt to learn it. Some fail to do so, even when they speak their native language fluently. We have to encode our thoughts as arbitrary marks on paper or the screen and interpret similar marks produced by others. Like speech, different kinds of written language suit different circumstances. An email or text message in a variety of language that many of us would not understand is perfectly appropriate between people who do understand such language. The question of whether or not it is correct simply does not arise. However, such language in, say, a job application or a Times leader would be unacceptable, and consequently ineffective, if it was incomprehensible to its readers, or if it simply antagonized them. That seems to me a more important consideration than whether or not it conforms to someone’s idea of correctness.</p> 
         <p>Those who commit words to print should consider what they are trying to express, who their readers are, and whether the chosen language will succeed in conveying the message clearly without hesitation, repetition or deviation. And it is helpful if, in writing which is destined to be read by a large number of people whose linguistic backgrounds we cannot know, we agree on certain conventions. These conventions include punctuation, spelling, and choice of vocabulary and structures. In speech we generally know personally our audiences. In writing, too, we will sometimes know our readers and we can adapt our language accordingly. Quite often, we will not. In those cases, a certain commonality is required to avoid chaos.</p> 
         <p>When I read a sentence I ask not so much, ‘Is it correct?’ but, ‘Do I want to read any more of this stuff?’ ‘Getting it right’ means successfully using language to achieve the purpose intended, not necessarily complying with a set of rules. Achieving the purpose intended includes producing the response on the part of our readers thaty we want them to have. Placing the emphasis on effectiveness rather than correctness seems to me more likely to produce the desired result. The alternative seems to suppose that once you have complied with the rules laid down by this or that authority you have done all you need to. That is far from the truth.</p>

         <p>Apostrophes are lovely little critters, but they tend to boggle the mind if you think about them too much.&nbsp; One of the most common questions on EL&amp;U regards proper usage of an apostrophe to indicate possession.</p> 
         <h2>The basics.</h2> 
         <p><strong>How do we use an apostrophe to indicate possession?</strong></p> 
         <p>If the <em>possessing</em> noun is singular, add an 's (apostrophe-s).</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sara</span>'s beast friends were all balrogs.
         </blockquote> 
         <p>If the <em>possessing</em> noun is plural and ends in s, add an ' (apostrophe).</p> 
         <blockquote>
          The beasty
          <span style="text-decoration: underline"> balrogs</span>' game was very fun.
         </blockquote> 
         <p>Well, now, that’s pretty straightforward, right? Except that apostrophes have this annoying habit of jumping into your brain and scrambling your thoughts.&nbsp; There are lots of ways to get confused.</p> 
         <p><strong>What if the <em>possessing</em> noun is plural and does not end in s?</strong></p> 
         <p>Then treat it like the singular case, and add an 's (apostrophe-s).</p> 
         <blockquote>
          The 
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">children</span>'s books were tucked away in their cubbies. The 
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">geese</span>'s honking alerted the dog to the fox’s presence.
         </blockquote> 
         <p><strong>What if the <em>possessing</em> noun is not plural, but ends in s?</strong></p> 
         <p>Well, golly, it turns out this one is complicated.&nbsp; <a title="Singular nouns ending in s" href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1073/what-is-the-correct-possessive-for-nouns-ending-in-s">Generally speaking</a>, these are treated just the same as other singular nouns:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          The 
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">glass</span>'s rim was cracked.
         </blockquote> 
         <p>But this has not always been the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a title="Names ending in s" href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/2964/when-did-it-become-correct-to-add-an-s-to-a-singular-possessive-already-ending">Historically</a>, <em>names</em> ending in s followed the plural rule:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          *
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Seamus</span>' writings were well-known throughout Galway.
         </blockquote> 
         <p>For proper nouns, this is considered a stylistic choice, but following the singular form is more common these days:</p> 
         <blockquote>
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Seamus</span>'s writings were well-known throughout Galway.
         </blockquote> 
         <p>You’d think with just four rules (which are really just two if you think about it) that noöne would have much trouble with possessive apostrophes. But those apostrophes sure are pernicious.</p> 
         <h2>The Advanced.</h2> 
         <p><strong>What if the possessing noun is a conjoined phrase like “my wife and I”?</strong></p> 
         <p>Kosmonaut gives <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/a/22073/8360">an excellent answer</a> to <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/4226/is-my-wife-and-is-correct-or-should-it-be-my-wifes-and-my">this question</a>.</p> 
         <p>&nbsp;</p> 
         <p><strong>Those rules are all well and good, but how do I decide whether the possessing noun should be plural or not in the first place?</strong></p> 
         <p>There are a lot of questions about this very sticky wicket on EL&amp;U.&nbsp; Some examples are:</p> 
         <p><a title="User's or Users' Guide" href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/36657/users-guide-vs-users-guide">User’s or Users’ Guide</a></p> 
         <p><a title="User or Users Account" href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1314/user-accounts-or-users-account">User or Users Account</a></p> 
         <p><a title="User's Users' Users" href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/76593/users-users-users-group">User’s/Users’/Users Group</a></p> 
         <p><a title="Mothers' or Mother's Day" href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/24367/apostrophes-and-caps-in-happy-mothers-day-happy-mothers-day">Happy Mothers’ Day or Happy Mother’s Day</a></p> 
         <p><a title="Members' or Member's Benefits" href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/51402/members-benefits-vs-members-benefits">Members’ or Member’s Benefits</a></p> 
         <p><a title="Beginner's Guide" href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/5804/apostrophe-in-beginners-guide">Beginner’s or Beginners’ Guide</a></p> 
         <p><a title="Baker's Dozen" href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/65093/usage-of-apostrophe-in-bakers-dozen">Baker’s Dozen</a></p> 
         <p>Does the guide belong to one user or many users?&nbsp; Is the day for one mother or all mothers?&nbsp; Either way is technically acceptable, but generally speaking, we consider a single instance and an abstract entity.&nbsp; So one copy of the guide for one abstract generalization of user means we usually say “User’s Guide.”&nbsp; Mother’s Day is trickier because we could celebrate all mothers on that day, but it is supposed to be a day on which we honor our own mother, so “Happy Mother’s Day” unless you have two mommies.</p> 
         <p>Finally, we see that possessive apostrophes are disappearing for plural nouns that demonstrate affiliation, so it is acceptable practice to use phrases like “User Group” instead of “Users’ Group.”</p> 
         <p>That is a little summary of possessive apostrophes, along with some fun links for further reading.</p>
