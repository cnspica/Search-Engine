       <p>A question on EL&amp;U “<a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/224005/on-the-origin-of-blizzard/224893#224893">On the origin of ‘blizzard’</a>” asked about the origin of the word <i>blizzard</i>. The history of usage of the word during the period between when it first appears in print in the United Sates (1834) and when it is first used in the sense of “a fierce snowstorm” is fascinating (to me)—but even a less than exhaustive account of that history of usage too long to serve as an appropriate EL&amp;U answer. Consequently, I’m putting it here.</p> 
       <h2>PART I. Dictionary and Scholarly Analyses of ‘Blizzard’</h2> 
       <p>One weakness in some modern analyses of <i>blizzard</i> involves a failure to acknowledge the wide (and widening) extent of usage of the word prior to 1870, acting instead as though <i>blizzard</i> as Davy Crockett understood the word in 1834 and <i>blizzard</i> as used by Iowa farmers in 1870 had nothing in common but a coincidental spelling. A look at the actual history of U.S. usage of the word strongly suggests to me that the 1830s usages (of which there were more than one) almost certainly are ancestral to the 1870 usage. Unfortunately, attempting to substantiate this hypothesis entails reviewing a considerable number of examples from the period 1835 to 1870. Let’s start by looking at some early U.S. assessments of the word <i>blizzard</i>.</p> 
       <hr> 
       <p><b><i>Nineteenth-century U.S. analyses</i></b></p> 
       <p>The entry for <i>blizzard</i> in J.S. Farmer &amp; W.E. Henley, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=CbATAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=%22blizzard+subs+popular%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Qb7JVKelKZbdoATxloLoDQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22blizzard%20subs%20popular%22&amp;f=false"><i>Slang and Its Analogues</i></a> (1890) is interesting, in part, because it reports on the word as a recently popularized term:</p> 
       <blockquote>
        <b>blizzard</b> 
        <i>subs.</i> (popular). — A poser [defined elsewhere in the dictionary as “an unanswerable question or argument”] ; a stunning blow ; an unanswerable argument, etc., etc.This word, brought into prominent notice as the name by which sudden and exceptionally severe snow storms are known in the Western States of America, is one the etymology of which is dubious. Some authorities derive it from the German 
        <i>blitz</i>—lightning, but a correspondent of 
        <i>N[otes] &amp; Q[ueries]</i> claims it as of English nationality, asserting that the word has been known in the Midland Counties in its present form, or nearly so, for over thirty years ; further stating that ‘may I be blizzered’ is a common oath there. Assuming that the expression is a variation of the more generally familiar ‘May God strike me blind’ (that is, presumably by lightning), there is nothing antagonistic between the two theories of its genesis, and a further light is perhaps thrown upon the subject, tending to support its German origin, by the fact that, in Pennsylvania, it has been familiar, according to a correspondent of the 
        <i>New York Sun</i>, for more than half a century, its use and meaning being akin to the instances above mentioned. It appears that in the central counties of the State in question, the word was always used to include the idea of the ‘poser,’ and even of force, violence, spitefulness, or vindictiveness. If one dealt another a hostile blow, he ‘gave him a BLIZZARD on the nose,’ ‘on the jaw,’ ‘between the eyes,’ etc. If a magistrate lectured a litigant severely he ‘gave him a BLIZZARD.’ If in debate one dealt mercilessly in ridicule he ‘gave his opponent a BLIZZARD.’ If one man swore at or cursed another he ‘gave him a BLIZZARD.’ If a man’s wife scolded him she ‘gave him a BLIZZARD.’ When it is remembered that Pennsylvania is the State in which the Dutch or German element most largely predominates, it does not seem far fetched to attribute its origin to a Teutonic source, more especially as there is nothing in the English usage to preclude such a derivation. However this may be, the word invariably seems to imply suddenness combined with violence ; and, at any rate, it apparently disposes of the supposition that the word is of Western origin, or a coinage of so recent a date as is frequently supposed. Like most words of its class, which have largely struck the popular taste, it has been generally adopted in an idiomatic sense to signify a stunning blow ; an overwhelming argument, or a cool reception. [First example:] 1834 [David] Crockett, 
        <i>Tour Down East</i>, 16. A gentleman at dinner asked me for a toast ; and supposing that he meant to have some fun at my expense, I concluded to go ahead and give him and his likes a BLIZZARD.
       </blockquote> 
       <p>A fuller version of the Davy Crockett quotation appears in Crockett, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=4b4TAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22his+likes+a+blizzard%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RrrJVIv1JZDWoATr7YFA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22his%20likes%20a%20blizzard%22&amp;f=false"><i>An Account of Col. Crockett’s Tour to the North and Down East, in the Year of Our Lord One Thousand Eight Hundred and Thirty-four</i></a>, tenth edition (1837):</p> 
       <blockquote>
        When dinner was ready [on a steamboat running from Delaware City to Philadelphia], I sat down with the rest of the passengers ; among them was the Reverend O. B. Brown, of the Post Office Department, who sat near me. During dinner the parson called for a bottle of wine, and called on me for a toast. Not knowing whether he intended to compliment me, or abash me among so many strangers, or have some fun at my expense, I concluded to go ahead and give him and his likes a 
        <b>blizzard</b>. So our glasses being filled, the word went round, “a toast from Colonel Crockett.” I gave it as follows: “Here’s wishing the bones of tyrant kings may answer in hell, in place of gridirons, to roast the souls of Tories on.” At this the parson appeared as if he was stump’t. I said, “Never heed ; it was meant for where it belonged.” He did not repeat his invitation, and I eat my dinner quietly.
       </blockquote> 
       <p>John Bartlett, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9sVUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22blizzard+a+poser+this+word+is+not+known%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Fb7JVKvXH4zhoAStuoL4BA&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22blizzard%20a%20poser%20this%20word%20is%20not%20known%22&amp;f=false"><i>Dictionary of Americanisms</i></a> (1848) uses the truncated version of the Crockett quotation as the only example of blizzard in that dictionary. Here is Bartlett’s entry for the word:</p> 
       <blockquote>
        BLIZZARD. A poser. This word is not known in the Eastern States. [Example omitted.]
       </blockquote> 
       <p>Maximilian Schele De Vere, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=C-wIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA443&amp;dq=%22blizzard+a+term+referred+back%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6b_JVOClBIuZoQTp1IKQDg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22blizzard%20a%20term%20referred%20back%22&amp;f=false"><i>Americanisms; the English of the New World</i></a> (1872) has this to say about <i>blizzard</i>:</p> 
       <blockquote>
        <i>Blizzard</i>, a term referred back to the German 
        <i>Blitz</i>, means in the West a stunning blow or an overwhelming argument. [Bartlett’s version of the Crockett quotation omitted.]
       </blockquote> 
       <p>Like Farmer &amp; Henley’s treatment, the coverage of <i>blizzard</i> in Charles Norton, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QZXK3jQqb70C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22blizzard+a+political%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DcHJVJ_4B8a4oQT1xIL4BQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22blizzard%20a%20political%22&amp;f=false"><i>Political Americanisms: A Glossary of Terms and Phrases Current at Different</i></a> (1890) shows that the snowstorm meaning had become dominant:</p> 
       <blockquote>
        <b>Blizzard.</b>—A political party is said to have been struck by a 
        <i>blizzard</i> when it has suffered overwhelming and unexpected defeat at the polls. The etymology of the word is doubtful, but it is said to have been long in use in Midland England and among the Pennsylvania Dutch. Its specific American meaning is a violent and destructive snow-storm peculiar to the Northwest.
       </blockquote> 
       <p>Albert Barrere &amp; Charles Leland, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=et7WAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%22blizzard+american+a+word%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D8XJVP3GOs21ogSi1YKoDA&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22blizzard%20american%20a%20word%22&amp;f=false"><i>A Dictionary of Slang, Jargon &amp; Cant</i></a>, volume 1 (1897) finds a different instance of <i>blizzard</i> in Davy Crockett’s oeuvre, this one from 1836:</p> 
       <blockquote>
        <i>Blizzard</i>
        <i> (American), a word of many meanings. In one of the early Crockett almanacs about 1836 it appears as distinctly meaning a shot from a rifle. </i>
        <blockquote>
         <i>“The elder boys when they went to school carried their rifles to get a </i>blizzard
         <i> at anything they might meet on the road.”</i>
        </blockquote>
        <i> It has been conjectured that in this sense it was derived from blaze, or from the (Canadian) French </i>blesser
        <i>, to wound or hit. It was also applied to lightning at an early date. At present the tremendous wind-storms like the typhoon which sweep over the West are called </i>blizzards
        <i>. It possibly owes this later meaning to the German </i>blitz
        <i>. </i>
        <blockquote>
         <i>With reference to the word blizzard, a Western correspondent sends the following:—The word was first used in Marshall, Minn., some thirteen years ago. Some friends were enjoying themselves at a public-house, when a storm of wind and snow arose, and one of the number, looking up quickly, uttered a German expression (our correspondent has forgotten the words) which sounded very much like blizzard. His friends took it up and have since called a storm of wind accompanied by now a blizzard. Some years ago the origin of the word was sought and it was said to be Indian, and that an Indian used the expression (or one similar in sound) upon seeing some white men coming out off a severe snowstorm.—</i>Detroit Free Press
         <i>.</i>
        </blockquote>
        <i> The German expression here referred to is “blitzen!”</i>
       </blockquote>
       <i> </i>
       <p><i>The </i>Detroit Free Press<i> story sounds highly unreliable to me; the Crockett reference is interesting, though Google Books doesn’t find any other nineteenth-century citation of it, or the original itself.</i></p>
       <i> 
        <hr> <p><b><i>Early British analyses</i></b></p> </i>
       <p><i>The reference to </i>Notes and Queries<i> in </i>Slang &amp; Its Analogues<i> appears to be to two comments in the periodical. First, from the February 11, 1888 edition, this item from W. E. Buckley:</i></p>
       <i> </i>
       <blockquote>
        <i>BLIZZARD.—The American correspondence of the Times, Jan. 16 to 19, of this year, has contained details of a terrific blizzard, which had been raging in several of the N. and N.W. states. In the ‘New Engl. Dict.,’ Dr. Murray says that it is a modern word, and in the sense of a “snow-squall” became general in the severe winter of 1880–81, although it had been so applied about 1860 to 1870. It seems to have been adopted by English journalists since 1880, from the Americans. The earliest example quoted is in 1834, from Col. Crockett’s ‘Tour down East,’ in the sense of a “poser,” as if a blast they could not stand. The snowstorm of Jan. 18, 1881, in this country was no feeble instance of a blizzard, as it blew up and about the </i>poudre
        <i>, or dry snow, in all directions.</i>
       </blockquote>
       <i> <p>And second, from Thomas Ratcliffe of Worksop, Nottinghamshire, in the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9GECAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=%22blizzer%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9MrJVJHZN8zeoASjmoCYCg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22blizzer%22&amp;f=false">March 17, 1888, edition</a>:</p> </i>
       <blockquote>
        <i>BLIZZARD (7th S. v. 106).—The word </i>blizzard
        <i> is well known through the Midlands, and its cognates are fairly numerous. I have known the word and its kin fully thirty years. Country folk use the word to denote blazing, blasting, blinding, dazzling, or stifling. One who has had to face a severe storm of snow, hail, rain, dust, or wind, would say on reaching shelter that he has “faced a blizzer,” or that the storm was “a regular blizzard.” A blinding flash of lightning would call forth the exclamation, “My! that wor a blizzomer!” or “That </i>wor
        <i> a blizzer!” “Put towthry sticks on th’ fire, an let’s have a blizzer”—a blaze. “A good blizzom” = a good blaze. “That tree is blizzared” = blasted, withered. As an oath the word is often used, and “May I be blizzerded” will be readily understood.</i>
       </blockquote>

       <p><i>In this regard, it is regrettable that the English Dialect Society, which produced such fine work in other counties of England during the nineteenth century, seems not to have published a full-scale glossary of Nottinghamshire words. In his </i>English Dialect Dictionary<i> (1898), Joseph Wright lists <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=oEMOAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=%22English+Dialect+Society%22+Nottinghamshire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SaTNVICRHYbioASAgIGADA&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22English%20Dialect%20Society%22%20Nottinghamshire&amp;f=false">three undated ms collections</a> of Nottinghamshire words, by three different authors, but I don’t know whether any of these ever saw publication. Part of the problem may have been that such a glossary (by a fourth compiler) was widely anticipated to be well on the way toward completion. In January 1875, in a section of the </i>Second Report for the Year 1874<i> titled “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5so9AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=%22English+Dialect+Society%22+Nottinghamshire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SaTNVICRHYbioASAgIGADA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22English%20Dialect%20Society%22%20Nottinghamshire&amp;f=false">Work in Course of Preparation</a>,” the society had written this:</i></p>

       <p><i>Worksop is also the town from which Ratcliffe sent his communication to </i>Notes and Queries<i> in 1888. But as far as I can tell, the White manuscript was never published. If some of Ratcliffe’s claims about the Midlands use of </i>blizzard<i> were true locally in Nottinghamshire, we might have found that fact corroborated in White’s glossary. Instead, as S.O. Addy, remarked at the end of a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=piIDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA33&amp;dq=%22I+might+mention,+for+instance,+Nottinghamshire,+and+the+east+and+south+of+Derbyshire%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F6nNVNz5A5LsoATQgYKQDA&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20might%20mention%2C%20for%20instance%2C%20Nottinghamshire%2C%20and%20the%20east%20and%20south%20of%20Derbyshire%22&amp;f=false">speech to the English Dialect Society</a> on October 13, 1906, that county remained oddly neglected:</i></p>

        <blockquote>

       <p><i>Joseph Wright’s English Dialect Dictionary follows Ratcliffe in listing </i>blizzarded<i> (“Used imprecatively”), </i>blizzer<i> (“A blaze, flash ; a blinding flash of lightning”), and </i>blizzom<i> (“A blaze, a flash”) as being “in gen. use in the midl. counties”—but the only source he supplies for each of these terms is Ratcliffe’s comment in </i>Notes &amp; Queries<i>. The array of ten counties that Wright lists individually as using </i>blizzy<i> provides a rather sharp contrast to the thinness of the support for the previous three terms.</i></p>

       <p><i>In its very lengthy treatment of </i>blizzard<i>, </i>Webster’s Word Histories<i> (1989) gives considerable play to the word’s connection to a major snowstorm in Iowa in 1870:</i></p>
       <i> </i>
       <blockquote>
        <i><p><b>blizzard</b> There is a tradition of sorts in Iowa that the word blizzard<i> for severe snowstorm with high winds originated there. Allen Walker Read went to Iowa in 1926 to look into the tradition, and his findings, published in 1928, show that there is considerable evidence in its favor. The earliest printed citation for the use that is so far known appeared in the Estherville, Iowa, </i>Northern Vindicator<i> on 23 April 1870. It was spelled </i>blizards<i>, and was cautiously enclosed in quotation marks. One week later, in the 30 April edition, it appears again, with the now familiar double -z spelling, but still in quotation marks. In June of 1870 the local baseball team adopted the name </i>Blizzards<i>—it must have been a memorably hard winter.</i></p><i> <p>…</p> </i><p><i>The relatively rapid spread of an unusual word has naturally excited some speculation about its origin, and a number of explanations have been offered for it. Since many of these appeared a long time after </i>blizzard<i> became common, it is impossible to verify them. Some claim credit for one locality or another, giving the speculations an air of home-town rivalry. The </i>Dictionary of Americanisms<i> has citations dated 1859 and 1861 from a diary published in the </i>Kansas Historical Quarterly<i> in 1932. The diary was kept by an army captain at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. It turns out, however, that the diarist revised or enlarged or rewrote the diary about 1905, when </i>blizzard<i> was a common word, and we do not know whether he unconsciously used it in his revision, or if he had used it in the original, which was unfortunately thrown away. No printed evidence, however, has yet been found that antedates the </i>Northern Vindicator<i>.</i></p><i> </i><p><i>The (possibly adulterated) <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=fDAUAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22chilled+could+not+get+up%22&amp;dq=%22chilled+could+not+get+up%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vZ_MVPKiHpWyoQTIiYB4&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ" target="_blank">1859 diary example</a> from the 1932 </i>Kansas Historical Quarterly<i> reads as follows:</i></p><i> <p>Sure it would freeze the horn of a brass monkey, remarked Kelly, (an old veteran), and I thought it might do it, for a <b>blizzard</b> had come upon us about midnight and I thought it a howling success. No breakfast, formed line, shot 7 horses that were so chilled could not get up, started out by twos from the right, trot march for Cottonwood creek.

By the 1840s it was widely understood to mean a cannon shot, and during the American Civil War (1861–65) both sides were using “blizzard” to mean a withering volley of musket or cannon fire. As for meteorological applications, “blizzard” was used in the 1850s for a sudden and violent drop in temperature. It was first used to describe a snowstorm in 1870 when O.C. Bates, neologistic editor of The Northern Vindicator of Estherville, Iowa, used it for the terrific snowstorms that socked in the state that spring. He claimed he had picked up the term from a local character called Lightning Ellis but, either way, he made such frequent use of it that everyone, other newspapers included, started talking of “The Great Blizzard,” which forever changed the accepted meaning of the word. </i>

       <blockquote>
         A riot occurred at Morrow [Ohio] on Saturday evening, which will probably give some trouble to the parties engaged in it. A theft was committed by a colored man named Henry Watkins—a convict formerly in the Penitentiary—who was immediately arrested and committed to jail. This aroused the indignation of sundry persons in the village, who met on Friday and resolved that every negro should leave the place in one week thereafter. Notice was accordingly given, and on Saturday, as we understand, all had left with the exception of two, Charles Casey and his wife, who had been assured that they would be suffered to remain. The ardor of the mob—for so we must characterize every body of men who set the laws of the country at defiance and meditate and commit violence on the persons and property of others—was quickened by their wrath, and on Saturday night they changed the time of the exodus of the Casey family an demanded that they should gird up their loins, put on their sandals and march forthwith. Casey refused to obey. At ten o’clock they approached the dwelling of the latter, and commenced an assault with stones and clubs.—Casey took a position at the door, armed with an axe, and his wife guarded the window, club in hand. Soon the window was smashed in and a breach made through the door by the missiles of the assailants. An entry was then attempted by one of the mob, but the moment his head protruded through the door, Casey tapped him with the back of the axe, and he fell senseless to the ground. Instantly another mob-head was poked in and met a similar 
        <b>blizzard</b>. These repeated and effectual rebuffs brought the mob to a parley.

        We stop the Press to announce that we have been creditably informed, that the Whigs have succeeded in bringing out Jackson, of Giles, for Floater [“A candidate representing several counties and therefore not considered directly responsible to any one of them”—Slang and Its Analogues], as we predicted they would, in another column. This information, we trust, will be sufficient to arouse every Democrat within the district to come out and do his whole duty. Yes, fellow Democrats, come out and vote for the man who is most likely to beat the Whig Missionary of Giles; it is enough to know, without saying a word about the importance of next Legislature, that this man Jackson is not only Whig of the deepest dye, but is the man who undertook to blackguard the people of Lincoln [County, Tennessee] by contributing money to send a Missionary up here to enlighten us.

        A regiment was lying down upon the field before him, waiting to be called into action. Shot and shell were whizzing furiously over them. The Chief [General Rosecranz] dashed up to the line and addressed them: ”Men, do you wish to know how to be safe? Shoot low. Give them a

His request was not complied with, whereupon he indulged in phrases having special application to Mr. H. but altogether unfit for ears polite. A Mr. Ray, who happened to be present, endeavored to appease the mightiness of his wrath, but without success. Mr. H. then intimated to his would be customer that he had better step outside of his threshold, and for his pains got a “

       <p><b><i>Summary of the cited examples</i></b></p> 
       <p>The cited uses of <i>blizzard</i> above break out into the following senses, with years of occurrence following):</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li><p>Blast with a firearm or cannon (whether one or multiple bullets or pellets uncertain): 1834, 1834, 1836, 1846, 1846, 1862</p></li> 
        <li><p>Verbal blast: 1835, 1848, 1851, 1860, 1861, 1863, 1865, 1868</p></li> 
        <li><p>Blast with a firearm or cannon (single ball or bullet): 1835, 1857, 1863</p></li> 
        <li><p>Blazing fire: 1843</p></li> 
        <li><p>Heavy or painful physical blow (not involving a firearm): 1849, 1856, 1860, 1861, 1866, 1870, 1870</p></li> 
        <li><p>Literal or figurative attack: 1851, 1866, 1867</p></li> 
        <li><p>Exclamation (like “the blazes” or “blue blazes”): 1853, 1857</p></li> 
        <li><p>Blast with multiple firearms or with a firearm loaded with multiple pellets): 1860, 1863, 1863</p></li> 
        <li><p>Shot of liquor: 1870</p></li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>Several things are noteworthy about these results. First, within thirteen years of the first confirmed use of <i>blizzard</i> in the sense of “snowstorm,” the word was being used in at least five other distinct senses (firearm blast, verbal blast, physical blow, exclamation, and shot of liquor). Second, the usage doesn’t seem as geographically narrow as we might have expected from the contemporaneous identification of blizzard as a “Western” word: Stories using the word appeared in newspapers located in California, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia. Third, in the 1860s use of the term in its various meanings seems to have been on the increase. Fourth, we see the emergence around 1860 of the use of blizzard in the sense of a volley or fusillade or flurry of pellets or bullets. The conceptual distance between such a flurry of missiles and a snowstorm is far less than the distance between a single bullet and a snowstorm.</p> 
       <p>In view of these considerations, I think it is highly likely that <i>blizzard</i> in the sense of snowstorm emerged not independently of the other meanings or directly from a Midlands English dialectal usage, but from one of the several U.S. slang meanings of the word that were then current. As for whether those words arose out of Anglo-Saxon <i>blysa</i>, French <i>blesser</i>, German <i>Blitz</i>, or onomatopoeic <i>blizzzz-urd</i> remains a matter for speculation.</p>
