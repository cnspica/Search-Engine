    &lt;p&gt;More often than not OpenID Foundation members vote with their feet. Members typically signal their interest in a topic or work group by participating on a spectrum from &amp;#8220;leader to lurker&amp;#8221; on a mailing list discussion or in a work group&amp;#8217;s agenda setting. On important, rare occasions, real people have to cast real votes. Votes decide things in presidential elections or in standards development organizations like the OpenID Foundation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two elections just concluded in the OpenID Foundation. The Vote to Approve Implementer’s Drafts of OpenID HEART Specifications just passed after a successful &amp;#8220;get out the vote&amp;#8221; campaign by Work Group Chairs Deb Bucci and Eve Maler with help from Board Secretary Mike Jones. In the &amp;#8220;sausage making&amp;#8221; of standards development votes like these really matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The vote for the corporate board representative also just concluded with Dale Olds&amp;#8217; election. I asked Dale to share a few remarks about what we might expect from his leadership. He shared the following; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m honored to be elected to the board of the OpenID Foundation. In the past few years VMware has become much more active in federated identity services, both with their own products and integrations with other vendors&amp;#8217; products. While I expect to primarily contribute to technical issues, I plan to use my position on the board to push for increased participation by VMware and AirWatch in working groups and events. With that said, I also recognize that my position is to represent the perspective of all the corporate members, not just VMware. I encourage other corporate members to contact me if they would like to voice a concern or if they desire an issue brought to the board&amp;#8217;s attention. Looking forward to a productive term!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to all who took the time to vote. The contribution of your time, talents and votes are the lifeblood of volunteer-driven organizations like the OpenID Foundation and as a result; solutions are improved, standards are strengthened and customers and end-users are better served.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don Thibeau&lt;br /&gt; The OpenID Foundation&lt;/p&gt;

All corporate members were eligible to nominate, second and vote for candidates. &nbsp;I am pleased to announce the election of Dale Olds to the&nbsp;OpenID Foundation Board. This will be Dale&amp;#8217;s first time serving&nbsp;on&nbsp;the Board and he will bring a fresh perspective to complement his considerable technical and &nbsp;business experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to thank Torsten Lodderstedt, of Deutsche Telekom, who has made important contributions during his tenure as a Director. Torsten has helped drive international outreach and led the resolution of complex security challenges. His continued Chairmanship of the MODRNA Working Group helps provide a clear path forward for OpenID Connect&amp;#8217;s contribution to standards development on global mobile platforms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;I wanted to acknowledge all those who put themselves forward as candidates and those now serving. Board participation is a substantial investment of time and energy and requires diligent&nbsp;consensus building.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Please join me in thanking George and Dale as well as the other Directors for their service to the OpenID Foundation and the community at large.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The inaugural meeting of the iGov Working Group took place on Wednesday, January 14th where three co-chairs were elected by acclamation. John Bradley of Ping Identity, Paul Grassi of the US NIST and Adam Cooper of the UK Cabinet Office Identity Assurance Program are the elected co-chairs. Acclamation may be a bit strong describing an electoral process closer to being shanghaied. All the same, all of us know leadership is a classic &nbsp;key success factor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;However leaders emerge, they are essential to success especially in the &amp;#8220;sausage making&amp;#8221; of standards development. The configuration of iGOV&amp;#8217;s leadership is intentional. The leaders map onto the WG&amp;#8217;s mission: John&amp;#8217;s Chilean/Canadian identity together&nbsp;with his unique technical chops; together with Paul Grassi&amp;#8217;s past pedigree and present position in the US Government; together with Adam Cooper&amp;#8217;s architectural expertise than stretches into European standards and schemes form iGOV&amp;#8217;s leadership team.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Leaders lead and we look to these men to manage the process and lead work group contributors to a common goal. Please consider joining this effort. The work group&amp;#8217;s goal is to have a common deployment profile that can be customized for the needs of&nbsp;both pubic and private sector deployments in multiple jurisdictions that may require the higher levels of security and privacy protections that OpenID Connect currently supports.&nbsp;The resulting profile&amp;#8217;s goal is to enable users to authenticate and&nbsp;share consented attribute information with public sector services across the globe.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The full draft charter is available at&nbsp;&lt;a href="http://openid.net/igov-wg-draft-charter/"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;http://openid.net/igov-wg-draft-charter/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The OpenID Foundation plays an important role in the interoperability of Internet identity. This is to announce the OpenID Foundation Individual community board member 2016 election schedule. Those elected will help determine the role the Foundation plays in facilitating the adoption of open identity standards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Per our bylaws, Individual community Members elect three (3) board members to represent them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;George Fletcher’s term is expiring this year. Mike Jones and John Bradley have 1 additional year on their 2 year terms. I want to thank George for his service to the OIDF and the community at large. George is eligible to seek re-election and has indicated that he intends to nominate himself for another term.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Individual community board member election will be conducted on the following schedule:&lt;br /&gt; • Nominations open: Monday, January 4, 2016&lt;br /&gt; • Nominations close: Monday, January 18, 2016&lt;br /&gt; • Election begins: Wednesday, January 20, 2016&lt;br /&gt; • Election ends: Wednesday, February 3, 2016&lt;br /&gt; • Results announced by: Wednesday, February 10, 2016&lt;br /&gt; • New board terms start: Wednesday, February 24, 2016&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Times for all dates are Noon, U.S. Pacific Time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All members of the OpenID Foundation are eligible to nominate themselves, second the nominations of others including those who self-nominated, and vote for candidates. If you’re not already a member of the OpenID Foundation, we encourage you to join now at &lt;a href="https://openid.net/foundation/members/registration"&gt;https://openid.net/foundation/members/registration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Voting and nominations are conducted using the OpenID you registered when you joined the Foundation. If you are already a member, you have received an email from me at director@oidf.org advising you that the election is open and how to participate. You will need to log in with your OpenID membership credentials at &lt;a href="https://openid.net/foundation/members/"&gt;https://openid.net/foundation/members/&lt;/a&gt; to participate in nominations and voting. If you experience problems participating in the election or joining the foundation, please send an email to &lt;a href="mailto:help@oidf.org"&gt;help@oidf.org&lt;/a&gt; right away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Board participation requires a substantial investment of time and energy. It is a volunteer effort that should not be undertaken lightly. Should you be elected, expect to be called upon to serve both on the board and on its committees. If you’re committed to open identity standards work well with others, we encourage your candidacy. The OIDF’s Executive Committee suggests a few questions candidates may want to publically address in their candidate statements:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. What are the key opportunities you see for the OpenID Foundation in 2016?&lt;br /&gt; 2. How will you demonstrate your commitment in terms of resources, focus and leadership?&lt;br /&gt; 3. What would you like to see accomplished in 2016; how do you personally plan to make this happen?&lt;br /&gt; 4. What other resources can you bring to the foundation to help the foundation attain its goals?&lt;br /&gt; 5. What current or past experiences, skills, or interests will inform your contributions and views?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Candidates can address these questions in their election statements on various community mailing lists, especially &lt;a href="mailto:openid-general@lists.openid.net"&gt;openid-general@lists.openid.net&lt;/a&gt;. Please forward questions, comments and suggestions to me at &lt;a href="mailto:don@oidf.org"&gt;don@oidf.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don Thibeau&lt;br /&gt; Executive Director&lt;br /&gt; The OpenID Foundation&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The OpenID HEART Working Group recommends approval of the following specifications as OpenID Implementer’s Drafts:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Health Relationship Trust Profile for OAuth 2.0&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Health Relationship Trust Profile for OpenID Connect 1.0&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Health Relationship Trust Profile for User Managed Access 1.0&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;An Implementer’s Draft is a stable version of a specification providing intellectual property protections to implementers of the specification. This note starts the 45-day public review period for the specification drafts in accordance with the OpenID Foundation IPR policies and procedures. This review period will end on Sunday, January 24th, 2016. Unless issues are identified during the review that the working group believes must be addressed by revising the drafts, this review period will be followed by a seven-day voting period beginning on Monday, January 25th, 2016 during which OpenID Foundation members will vote on whether to approve these drafts as OpenID Implementer’s Drafts.

    &lt;p&gt;The Japanese Mobile Network Operator and market leader &lt;a href="http://news.kddi.com/kddi/corporate/newsrelease/2015/11/10/1444.html"&gt;KDDI has joined the Board of Directors of the OpenID Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. KDDI joins Verizon and Deutsche Telekom as global telco giants helping set the direction for OpenID Connect on the platform of choice; the mobile device. KDDI&amp;#8217;s leadership comes at an opportune time as the MODRNA Working Group (Mobile Operator Discovery Registration and Authentication) development of a profile of OpenID Connect for MNOs providing identity services for RPs (Relying Parties) is rapidly building consensus on optimizing global interoperability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KDDI brings practical user experience across a broad range of relying party applications. KDDI&amp;#8217;s will leverage OpenID Connect throughout its &amp;#8220;AU ID&amp;#8221; platform including &amp;#8220;AU Smart Pass,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;AU Wallet Market,&amp;#8221; as well as a portfolio of settlement services on prepaid cards and credit cards for a user base of over 25 million customers. KDDI&amp;#8217;s input, like that of others OIDF members like the GSMA, is critical to building reliable, flexible and scaleable deployments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KDDI&amp;#8217;s announcement was a highlight of the OpenID Foundation Japan Conference, a gathering of almost 500 developers, technologists and business leaders in Tokyo.&nbsp;Experts from Google, Microsoft, Ping Identity and others led an in depth review of the status of each OpenID Foundation working groups and conducted hands on self certification testing workshops. A series of presentations highlighted the linkage of technical protocols with trust frameworks governance rules. OpenID Foundation Japan is planning new initiatives around localization of documentation and a new wave of OpenID Connect self certifications by members large and small in early 2016.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2015/11/Yamamoto-Thibeau-225x300.jpg" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group23056"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-23101" src="http://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2015/11/Yamamoto-Thibeau-225x300-225x300.jpg" alt="Yamamoto-Thibeau-225x300" width="225" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The signers: Don Thibeau, ED of OIDF, and Yasuhide Yamamoto, Executive Officer of KDDI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2015/11/KDDI-1.jpg" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group23056"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-23046" src="http://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2015/11/KDDI-1-300x225.jpg" alt="KDDI 1" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2015/11/KDDI-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2015/11/KDDI-1.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2015/11/KDDI-2.jpg" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group23056"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-23051" src="http://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2015/11/KDDI-2-300x300.jpg" alt="KDDI 2" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2015/11/KDDI-2-150x150.jpg 150w, http://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2015/11/KDDI-2-300x300.jpg 300w, http://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2015/11/KDDI-2.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At the OpenID Certification Launch in April 2015, 6 organizations had certified 8 OpenID Connect Provider implementations for 21 conformance profiles. Now, as you can see at &lt;a href="http://openid.net/certification/"&gt;http://openid.net/certification/&lt;/a&gt;, 14 organizations and individuals have certified 16 OpenID Connect Provider implementations for 48 conformance profiles. The OpenID Foundation has championed self-certification as an important new trust building mechanism that can operate at Internet scale, and it’s working well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new certifications represent a broad set of industries and application areas: large companies like Deutsche Telekom – a leading European mobile operator, and small companies like Privacy Vaults Online (PRIVO) – which manages parental consent for children’s online access. This latest wave of certifications include more from Microsoft – certifying their on-premises identity software, as well as developers like Cal Heldenbrand – in the real estate industry, and Dominick Baier, Brock Allen, Michael Schwartz, Justin Richer, and Roland Hedberg, each certifying their open source identity software. Congratulations to all for their achievements and for advancing interoperable digital identity across international borders and industry sectors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keep those certifications coming! Meanwhile, the ability to self-certify OpenID Connect Relying Parties is being finalized in anticipation of pilot RP certifications in 2016.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don Thibeau&lt;br /&gt;OpenID Foundation Executive Director&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="http://nstic.blogs.govdelivery.com/2015/10/21/launching-igov-secure-and-privacy-enhancing-identity-authentication-and-authorization-profiles-developed-on-an-international-scale/"&gt;US NIST announcement&lt;/a&gt; describes the newly formed OIDF International Government Assurance Profile (iGov) Working Group which is an international public and private sector collaboration that will develop an interoperable profile of OpenID Connect to allow users to authenticate and share consented attribute information in a consistent and user-centric manner. With over 10 international governments and multiple private sector organizations already participating, iGov will help enable secure and privacy-enhancing authentication and authorization transactions based on common requirements from the global community. The iGov WG Page is set up at: &lt;a href="http://openid.net/wg/igov/"&gt;http://openid.net/wg/igov/&lt;/a&gt; The link to subscribe to the mailing list is: &lt;a href="http://lists.openid.net/mailman/listinfo/openid-specs-igov"&gt;http://lists.openid.net/mailman/listinfo/openid-specs-igov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those interested in participating will need to submit signed IPR agreements indicating the iGov Profile WG. The link to the IPR agreement is at &lt;a href="http://openid.net/intellectual-property/"&gt;http://openid.net/intellectual-property/ &lt;/a&gt; The IPR agreement can be submitted online via DocuSign. IPR agreements have been received from NIST, Ping, and Microsoft. Once interested parties and OIDF members have signed up they will need to approve the iGov charter. Document contributions to the Working group should be sent to the mailing list, and then can be added to our official document repository.&lt;/p&gt;
